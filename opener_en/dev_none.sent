very warm welcome at the reception , very friendly and helpful personnel , especially at the bar and during breakfast , a really good experience overall , had a relaxing drink at the bar , visited the cigarrum smokers lounge and had a great start into the day at the very nicely assorted breakfast buffet .
The room is very small , about 10m2
Hotel Premiere Classe Orly Rungis is near the airport and close to Orly major highways ( all night heard the noise of passing large vehicles ) .
Near the hotel there is a bus stop that goes to the RER station .
In this area there is famous Rungis market , the largest food market in the world .
Transfer from the airport to the hotel we had a free ( ask about a transfer at the information desk at the airport ) .
Minibus goes from the airport to a hotel .
Transfer from hotel to airport · 6 Euro.
Best holidays ever !
Everything was excellent .
We enjoyed the time on the beach and the friendliness of the people working there .
Fantastic food , breathtaken view from the bar .
Great music and moments that we will always remember .See you next year .
Overnight
We stayed in this hotel as we arrived quite late in the day on out inbound flight from our summer holiday .
It is situated in Frankfurt Flughaven railway station , so as one might expect transport connections are superb .
The check in was quick and efficient , just what you need after a long flight .
The room was adequate .
We ordered room service .
The food came quickly , was hot , tasty , and expensive , very expensive .
However the room only cost 75 Euros for the night .
One of the cleanest Travelodges I 've been to !
This Travelodge is well placed in the City Centre and a short walk from the station and a short walk to the shops , restaurants etc. that Leeds has to offer .
The rooms are one of the cleanest Travelodges I 've been too however the corridors and reception area is a little rough from all of the Hen / Stag weekend traffic .
There were a few Stag weekenders checking in when we were however we didn 't experience any noise or unpleasantness that would stop us from coming back in the future for our city breaks to Leeds .
It a good location , basic , clean and thats all I can ask for for the price .
Excellent beach resort
Very large resort hotel but we were upgraded to suites on arrival , however these were an extremely long walk from the restaurant / reception approx 500 metres .
When walking problem were presented to the General Manager Mr Y. A. we were moved to two adjacent family rooms closer to these facilities and also given the blue bands allocated to repeat visitors , he could not have been more helpful .
It is a shame that given such ehormous pool area there is more unheated than heated and that would be my only complaint about the actual hotel facilities .
I would highly recommend this resort especially compared with ones in Sharm .
Tip top · top tip !
I have to say that I 've had a very nice holiday in this hotel .
Everybody was very kind and friendly .
Especially the team of the main restaurant was really professionell and nice .
I felt like a princess , sometimes ; · ) !
Thank you very much everybody !
I will come back there .
Business and shopping
Very warm comfortable friendly hotel .
It takes 20 min. to get to Corso Buenos Aires where you can find very nice shops .
At the hotel : rooms are not big , but nice and clean ( I was at this hotel several times and saw different rooms ) , clean comfortable bathrooms .
I prefer stay at this hotel , when they have free rooms .
I requested a non · smoking room , only to find a cigarette in the toilet .
After calling reception , they offered me an upgrade .
This however requires walking all around the hotel , and there is only one set of elevators for each floor ( the hotel is a pyramid , and the elevators are only in one corner ) .
The food was expensive .
And my salad was a dressing soup topped with some lettuce .
Location of the hotel and dinner excellent
· small rooms but a big balcony in rooms with seasight
· breakfeast ( buffet ) is good , dinner is excellent
· bathroom small , but clean
· matras familyroom was hard and bad in the single room
· Dutch ; 42 , 66 and 67 years
· wifi is free
Stay was too short
I stayed at the hotel for only 2 nights .
The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful .
Breakfast was perfect with a nice variety .
Hope to return to the area soon and will definently try and stay here again .
Steigenberger Airport Hotel Frankfurt
The staff is very friendly , prompt and courteous .
Check · in / Check · out was a piece of cake .
I got an upgrade to Executive suite at no cost .
Outbeaten cleanliness noticed from lobby to room .
I was impressed with the breakfast selection .
Great place , friendly and efficient staff
stayed for a weekend , good location between village and beach , accepts dogs · a must for us , great staff , very helpful
the car park gets a little busy when there is a function on , but all worked out with a bit of cooperation ; the breakfast times are fine during the week but I would have preferred a little later cut off on Sunday · again the staff sorted it to everýone 's satisfaction .
We had a groundfloor room so access for my scootmobile was no problem and parking of the scootmobile was also sorted without any fuss · a great team , staff and management .
Very nice hotel !
The hotel was very nice , I think it 's good that they have like 5 restaurants so the people are spread over 5 restaurants so it 's never so crowded .
But on the other hand I missed the a la carte restaurants that you have in so many hotels because that 's more pleasant / cosy .
The hotel is very clean !
The food was very good , I especially liked the breakfast because there were a lot of different kinds of cheese , and for dinner the Asian restaurant is my favorite .
There are mainly German people in the hotel ( I think 70 / 80 percent )
But what I really didn 't like was the music in the lobby bar en all the other bars , way to old !
I hope that next time thay have an area with modern music
Le Méridien Munich
We have stayed in this hotel for 4 nights recently .
Our room was a city view room facing Street .. So from a view perspective , there is nothing that we can wow about !!!
The decor of the hotel is very old just another 3 star hotel standard !!!
The room does have a LCD TV , i will not stay in this Hotel Again .
Expensive airport hotel
Basic Sheraton below my expectations .
Free shuttle bus to / from the airport .
Bell staff very good and helpfull .
Rooms recently refurbished but not in acordance of today 's traveller
Some staff does not speak any English at all !!
Pool area dated
Lounge very poor .
After breakfast no meals or drinks offered .
Dirty dishes , no fruit , empty firdge , loud TV
Good times , great people
We had a great time.The staff were great the food was great.And there is lots of private areas by the sea.What can i say.Love the Grand Palladium jamaica.And we hope to see all the staff next year .

Coming to rest
Friendly , clean hotel , with good sound isolation , so in general no noise from outside the room ! ! ! !
The wellness is an absolute pluspoint , tram to the centre of cologne stops right in front .
There 's underground parking but expensive .
I 've been coming to this hotel since 2000 and still returning .
The new management is a definete improvement
Rimini contemporary chic
Overall this is a very nice hotel for couples , families and likely even for singles , considering it 's proximity to the beach as well as Rimini 's main thoroughfare .
The staff is knowledgeable concerning special recommendations for restaurants and otherwise also very forthcoming .
The rooms with a small kitchen are highly recommended for those who want to save money and enjoy the delicacies that can be found at the weekly market in the old part of Rimini !
Very good hotel
hello .
I have to say that in my 8 days that I 've been. really good but could have had ot otherwise ok with 40 degrees and a nice breeze , we could well account for the pool .
The rooms looked very good every day , your room completely done. and then there 's the animation is very well organized for kids and for older people 's show every night. and this girl elina I must thank you for this nice holiday In this great hotel
marvin from holland
Last minute getaway in Brugge
We stayed there with our big dog , we pay 20 Euro a night for him , which is I guess normal here in Europe .
The staff were very friendly .
We didn 't stay much in the hotel since we spent most of the days outside .
There aren 't many English channel on TV unfortunately .
The location is ok if you are used to walk .
It 's about 15 · 20 minutes easy walk to the city center .
When we stayed there , there was a weird smell around the sitting area .
The worst vacation ever · anything but grand !
Sheets were stained too 4 times for mgmt to bring new ones all were stained .
Food was inedible bacteria haven !!!!
Cannot get any assistance with issues
Pool closes at 7
You are stuck once you book they will not allow you to change hotels .
Now back , no one will reply to emails and they do not answer phones
Only by lingual if you ask for basic Where is the bathroom forget about a conversation .
Hamburger meat was grey · set out next to hot grill
Dolphin
Enjoyed this holiday so much we booked again for the following year and will be booking again for 2014 , as returning guests we were given lots of extras.the food was supburb and catered for all different cultures and tastes.we had a cottage which was on the beach front which was very comfortable clean and spacious.the room boys took care of our every need.we still keep in touchwith the bar staff through sms.every one greets you with a smile and makes you feel special weather in feb was 35 / 40 degrees so all inclusive beer was welcome.would reccomend this hotel very higly . : )
There is no much to say , it is my 7th year I am spending holidays in this hotel .
I have spent a beautiful time in other expensive hotels throughout Europe , but definitely I found it is not the number of stars which define feelings .
I am enjoying in my way .
Sri Lanka · we will come again !
We had a wonderful stay in Sri Lanka .
Everybody was very kind · country is beautiful .
The staff at the Club Hotel Dolphin was very helpfull , they are taking care about the guests !
Thank you everybody !
Really nice hotel , quiet and confortable
Hotel not too far from center ( 25 minutes walk from main station , but tram station just in front of the hotel ) , room really quite , beds really confortable .
Great size room , incredible pool .
Breakfast varied and excellent .
Great holiday in Dana Beach Resort
it was my the best holiday.really everybody there are friendly and animation club was great I thing that you can find there everything from fun to have a rest .
I was only in castelo restaurat but there you can find all kind of food . super holiday
Who needs a room ( junior suite ) this large
The hotel looks , and is most likely , clean inside , which cannot be said from the outside .
Probably as soon as you are not on the premises anymore , it is not that clean .
During my walk this morning ; from the hotel to the office ; I got out of the hotel and walked to the escalator which is there and it smelled terrible !
The hotel features free Wireless Internet which is also pretty fast , which allows you to work and surf without any problems .
Using Skype may cause connection problems .
There is a bar in the hotel as well as a restaurant , and also in the immediate surroundings there are places to stay , if you 'd like to .
Old and very tired hotel
There are two reasons to choose this hotel : relatively low price comparing to other centrally located hotels and location in walking distance from the main station .
This hotel is very old and needs renovation long ago .
Tiny dark rooms with very basic comfort , practically , only beds .
Cheap bed linen and grey towels .
Thick windows and bad heating system .
Poor breakfast .
Very hard to get relaxed after long exploring of the city .
Great resort
the hotel is very clean and all the people who are working their are very friendly and willing to help .
The food in general is very very good also the rooms
Great location , attentive staff
This hotel has a great location , in the heart of Gran Via , and if you need to go somewhere , it is in front of a subway station .
The room was good , the service was very attentive · I said I needed to leave early in the morning to catch a flight ( which would make me lose breakfast ) , and the front desk offered me a takeaway basket with some fruits , cookies and juice so I could eat it on the go , all free of charge .
The only drawback from this hotel is that it is in an old building .
The design is old , and some might find it needs a restoration , but everything works perfectly .
A very friendly Hotel in a nice park area with excellent food and wine .
The rooms are not big , but nicely made .
The service is excellent and helpful in any case .
It is located next to the park and a rose garden in a calm area 10 min from the center of Trier
One of the worst hotels I 've ever seen .
Lobby was full of flies ( dead and alive ) , it was hot , humid and smelly .
Elevator is so small that two average persons and one suit case are having troubles to fit .
Rooms are small , smelly and very outdated .
Bath shower didn 't work , and the fridge was broken .
Most likely , I won 't return to this place .
Hotel Riverside
The hotel was underconstruction therefore there were problems with the heating .
The breakfast and diner aerea was freezing !
No actions were taken to get us any warmer .
My old room was very old and I hope that the new rooms will be of this time

Very Good Hotel fantastic Food
Simply Good , the Park behind the Hotel is stunning an charming .
The People are friendly and the Food is fantastic .
The only downside was the very small bathroom , and that you have to pay extra for carparking .
Dana is the best and we will be back again and again .
This year we have been staying at Dana 2 times .
Last year 2 times , the year before 2 times ........
We have had friends who have been at Dana morew than once
Dana Beach 2013
It was the second time at Dana Beach and we were pleases that the childrens swimmingpool was also heated now .
Last year it wasn 't. and due to the weather it was to cold for the children to use that pool ;
We will come back to Dana Beach .
Great location but very poor service and loud
Service was rather poor , and the reception staff was not very friendly or helpful .
Our room was right next to the bar / club area .
Also , we could hear the loud disco music till very late in the morning , and nothing could be done about it even after we complained .
The major plus : location is excellent and the price affordable .
Best vacation ever !
Overall our stay at the Grand Palladium was the best vacation I have ever had .
The food choices were outstanding .
The staff were friendly and knowledgeable .
The pool was amazing , the entertainment was excellent .
We cant began to say enough good things about our stay , but we will definitely be back this year ! ! !

He was soo handsome , nice and funny. i really want next holidays becouse i want to come back to hurghada to this hotel and meet Ala and others animators again .
Bad impression in Paris
The best reason to choose Lord Byron hotel was it 's location and price .
It 's locate near Champ Elysee , Arc de Triump and very close to George 5 metro station.The staff was very friendly .
But the room is very old and dirty .
We spend 4 night at this hotel .
After 2 nights we had itchhing , our last night in this hotel we can not slept because of itching .
We really want to going back to our home and had a good sleep ( and a medicine ) .
After we coming back to our home I got a redness rash the whole leg .
We had a bad impression about Paris .
Our trip in Paris was totally ruined by the itching from This hotel .
Awesome resort and vacation
Loved this holiday .
Wonderful people and wonderful place .
Couldn 't ask for a better resort · the people are just amazing .
