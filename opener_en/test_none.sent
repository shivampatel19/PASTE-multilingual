So wonderful to see people go to work smiling and leave work still smiling and happy .They were there just to keep us happy .
A wonderful place to go and we are planning to return as soon as we can .
Thank you for such a wonderful experience .
City trip to Amsterdam
Hotel was under construction .
Carpets where very old .
Staircase only on the outside and not heated .
The room was OK .
The TV stopped foor several moments because the internet connection wasn 't sufficient .
We had overall an OK stay at the hotel .
We went foor a cheap city trip and that 's what we have got .
Very cool hotel
hotel chic !
Animation team just super .
Food is delicious and all tastes .
Animation team , just super , very funny guys and animation has always been a very interesting.In swimming pool water is always warm.Barman is cool , it makes cocktails before your eyes.I advise everyone to relax in this hotel !
Service is bad but stylish and clean property
The staff in this hotel was really the major downside of my stay .
While the hotel is in great condition , the service ruined my experience .
Namely , requests were not handled or not handled in a timely manner .
For example , I ordered an iron to my room , but had to call twice and then go down to the reception to reconfirm my request .
The room cleaning then took the iron away without asking me ( I still needed it ) .
The safe in the hotel room and the air conditioning also broke down and I had to ask for someone to repair it .
However , the room and hotel is modern and attractive .
Flat was in a state , not worth the money paid
leaking toilet which floods floor ..... odd stains on sofa , had to sit on towels ..... fist hole in bedroom door ...... bed that collapses .
Need i say more ?
The location was in a great spot , sadly the state of the flat let it down .
Felt a little embarrassed to present this to my bf for his birthday weekend away .
Great location , small rooms
Stayed here before and after an educational conference in Barcelona ( our plane flew into Madrid ) .
The location of this hotel can 't be beat .
It is minutes from numerous restaurants , bars , etc. and centrally located between the Prado and the Palace · · great for walking .
The Metro also has a key station minutes from the front door .
The staff were helpful .
The rooms were on the small side and the amenities ( like Internet access ) were spotty at best .
But it was great value for an adult vacation in Madrid .
Good all rounder
really nice hotel , well laid out all rooms over look the pool. rooms are nice and large have tea coffee making facilties , mini fridge. loads of sunbeds not sure if it would be the same during school holidays. beach is clean they come round collecting plastic drink cups and empty water bottles.went to all four restaurants Asian being how favourite.used the spa which was excellent had the best back massage ever.staff so kind and friendly. you do get some aircraft noise with being so close to airport but not a big problem. choice of drinks are limited but you always find something to drink lovely cocktails. our ages 22 to 50 please go you will like it .
Wonderful Hotel , Clean Friendly very spacious
We Stayed at the Grand Hermitage for a week at the end of July start of August .
The rooms are huge .
Its extremely clean , the staff are friendly .
We went all inclusive and there is a good selection for the buffet .
we got engaged while we there and the hotel talk care of everything , Flowers Champagne , they even set up a special room for us .
That evening we went for a meal at the al a carte restaurant .
The food there was incredible .
We had two course and a bottle of champagne and it cost us £ 31 WOW .
Great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone .
Very dangerous area .
Stay in combination with a 5 · day bus trip organized by Peter Langhout Travel ( Holland )
My wife and son of four years , were attacked by three men of foreign origin on the 4th day of their stay in the morning , with a knife and robbed of bag and money in the elevator of the hotel !
Hotel and Dutch embassy and police have given little or no help or attention .
My wife had to borrow money from others to travel to the police by taxi .
Busdriver Peter Langhout was fortunately understanding and helpful .
Hotel itself was reasonable in terms of a place to sleep , but we never come back here because it 's not safe here !
The Vivaldi Hotel , quaint & friendly
The Vivaldi Hotel ( Puteaux , France ) is in walking distance to the metro ( Paris ) .
Although the room was small it was clean and quite servicable ( we spent most days sight · seeing in Paris .
We were treated to a full breakfast daily and the staff was friendly and very patient .
Special thank you ( s ) to the guest services associates Oliver & Marjoleine .
They were both helpful in providing directions and general info .
My wife and I especially enjoyed speaking with Oliver , and exchanging our respective views on life in France and the U.S. I do not know when we will get to France ( Europe ) again , but we will definitely consider the Vivaldi Hotel again .
Just good place for business
There are good conference rooms with all necessary infrastructure , good location allowing you to have nice evening , pool , restaurants , internet , 5 minutes to airport · everything you need to do a business and relax after that .
Interior is superb as well as rooms .
Don 't go · avoid this place !
Although these apartments may look great on the internet , don 't go .
We rented for a full week with our young children during Christmas holidays .
As the apartments can be rented per night it attrackts back packing , party focused youngsters who tend to overcrowd the apartments ( with more than the allowed amount of guests per apartment ) , smoke in the building , taking prostitutes into the premises , coming home between 4 and 6am drunk and under heavy influence of drugs .
Consequently , during our stay , guests had to be removed from their apartments by the police twice , as a result of heavy verbal fighting , the use of noisy fake alarms and drunk misbehaviour .
The staff takes no responsibility for this , telling this is not a hotel .
They don 't refund and just call the police all the time , so that they are not liable .
Сlaiming to be luxury
I enjoyed my 3 · night stay in the hotel , the room was very clean , well equipped but too huge for me ( I don 't think that many people need 50 sq.m hotel room ) .
Generally the hotel is not cozy , looks like a huge palace not very well utilized .
Although view of the mountains from my balcony was very nice .
I liked the spacious pool area , sauna and hamam .
It happened that I was the only one visitor each time I came .
Free wifi was of a decent speed .
Location is little far from city center .
Overall impression : claiming to be a luxury , but the service does not yet match .
Good working time in the Hotel Xenia
I spent three days at the Xenia Hotel on a project visit with partners from France , Hungary and Austria .
The meeting room was very well serviced ( the coffee machine was fabulous ) and we were able to focus on our Agenda without having to worry about the operational elements of the visit .
The technology provided worked fine ( skype ) for our needs .
The food was well presented and interesting · Greek dishes with a general European twist .
A beautiful setting by the sea · Ijust wish Ihad had time to make more of the very good facilities on offer .
Absolutely horrible accommodation for the money
Tiny room , no place to put luggage .
Dark , crazily designed bathroom with no electrical outlet , no soap dish in shower ( no bathtub ) , minuscule shelf for personal amenities .
Room was fully visible from the outside , and cleaning staff left curtains open daily , allowing anyone to see your belongings .
Meager , horrible breakfast , on a frigid outdoor terrace ( in February ) , with no indoor option whatsoever .
Entrance to rooms only by passing through bar area .
Totally overpriced , lousy service , bad location ( noise from houses close · by ) .
The hotel is nice and clean , but is very far from any nice sorrundings .
I was forced to stay in this area due to my business reason , but oterwise I would not suggest to come here to spend your holidys .
You can reach Madrid quite easily by using a nearby bus , but this would take an hour or so down to the city center .
Anyway the hotel is nice and personnel is very friendly and kind .
Nice hotel with a wonderful park
Next time we 'll book a room on the parkside .
Streetside is rather noisy in the morning .
Wellness offer and quality are very good .
Diner was excellent and the choice at breakfast was good too .
Very friendly staff !
Nice hotel in the centre of Nes .
Nice accomodation with a really great breakfast .
It is really close to the centre of Nes and you are within minutes at the beach with the bike .
The rooms were a lot smaller than expected and the bathroom had mold between some tiles , so that 's why we rated that part lower .
Absolutely gorgeous and super relaxing hotel
Stayed here with my wife for a short holiday .
Plus points · unique bed , built · in rain shower / bath tub , delicious French cuisine , very friendly staff , candy on the bed , in · room FREE coffee / tea , lovely and peaceful surroundings and the little gift when leaving the hotel was awesome .
Min points · tiny dinner portions : · (
For the 2nd time a fantastically stay
A big hotel ( about 700 rooms ? ) and a slendid garden and in some swimmingpool warm water .
They keep in repair very well ; they were painting now the balcony and in the passed yaer they had made new foot · paths .
The rooms are very clean .
Many people are also working in the garden and the water in the lagune and pond get cleaned the whole day .
There are a few couple from the Netherlands ; most people came from Germany .
Hotel is perfect !
Splendid hotel near shopping center " Diagonal Mar " .
Hotel staff very much .
While the hotel is not owned by Marriot so the price was much lower .
Now almost equal to the price of the Hilton , which is located nearby .
Very clean and fresh room !
This B & amp ; B was very clean and fresh .
The owners maintained the place very well .
Beddings were warm and comfortable .
Room was equipped with TV , radio , Kettle , Coffee maker , dvd player and a tv with so many channels .
Ample towels and toiletries were provided which many other B & amp ; B don 't usually provide enough .
Owners were very generous with the breakfast servings .
Alphons was very helpful in helping us with directions in the area as well as places to visit .
The only little problem was to us since we don 't travel light and the room is 2 floors up ...
Great Hotel !
We had a great one night stay at the hotel .
Big pluss is the huge park in connection to the hotel .
Our one year old son loved to run around there and there was a big playground in the park only a couple of hundred meters from the hotel .
I would most certainly recommend this hotel ! !
Nice hotel with good access to the city and Messe
Dorint an der Messe is a fine hotel for businesstrips and a city break .
Within 7 minutes you are in the centre of Koln Altstadt .
Here you can have a good shoppingday or visit one or another museum and ofcourse the Dom .
Try the apfelstrudl at Cafe Reichards ,
A brilliant oasis in a desert wilderness
What a terrific hotel resort , fantastically clean when one thinks of 700 rooms but always lots of space , the pools and the beach were constantly cleaned and manicured and sun beds were more than enough for everyone , with pool and beach towels always available .
We stayed on an all inclysive service and we could not fault the food or drink in any of the hotels restaurants or bars and the waiter service was totally five star .
The main nationalities were German and Swiss and afew of us Brits , but no problems there everyone got on really well .
Inclusive or ' All inclusive ' that is the question ?
Lovely and clean , nice rooms , nice location .
Paaid for All inclusive but this was not exactly what I received , for this I had to pay ' extra ' , All inclusive to this hotel is meals in the main self sevice restaurant , does not include any other restaurant on the site , the local fish market evening was extra as well as the ala carte , they do give you a RS375 off the ala carte menu which is an insult due to the price charged for self service .
There is no wine included in the All inclusive , not even with meals , this has to be paid extra , no liquires .
You can pay exrra for these by paying for a ' gold all inclusive ' package
Hotel The Fountains
It was really Bad .
We paid for 3 nights after the first night we tried to find another place .
Dirty.our room lock was brocken and we were not sure if someone came in .
really load and unfriendly staff .
we paied 1300 euro per night and for 3 night in advance ... we didn 't get our meny back ... but It was so worse then we moved out .
Advantages of this hostal · it is cheap and located in the center .
So there are many caffees , restaurants and shops nearby .
We were having breakfast in one of the caffees beside hostal and already on the second day we were welcomed like good friends .
Disadvantages · size and condition of the room .
My room was very small , I would even call it claustrophobic .
It was shaped like letter L in one part there was bed , old tv in other part wash basin , shower , toilet and window without the view .
There was soap provided .
There is lift in the building .
Perfect holiday
The hotel was exceptionally clean and you are spoilt for choice with regard to food ; there was an italian , oriental , mexican and asian restaurant as well as the two main buffet restaurants across both hotels .
The hotel boasts outstanding architecture and stands true to it 's name · a palace .
We started each day with a buffet breakfast , relaxed at the huge pools or beautiful beach and finished the evening with cocktails accompanied by a live singer .
There was also the amphitheatre next door with a variety of shows and entertainment each night .
I would also highly recommend United Brothers Photography who work at the hotel ; Valentino provided us with outstanding professional photographs at a bargain price .
Always a nice stay
I think it is important to say that I returned to this location for at least 12 times .
And I already booked my next stay for the end of this month ( July 2011 ) .
The hotel is great .
Although it has more than 700 rooms , you can feel the good management watching the co · ordination between the working personnel in fulfilling the needs of the guests .
The cleanliness is very good , breakfast is great and abundant , staff is helpful and trying to do things as fast as possible .
The hotel has an underground garage very well secured .
Fantasic hotel .
This hotel is fantasic , we went for a chilled out week away and it was amazing , the staff cannot do enough for you it 's ideally situated on the beach and it has it 's own waterpark which is great fun .
The hotel rooms are really big and spacious and cleaned daily and free soft drinks and water in the fridge which is restocked daily .
The all inclusive is 24 hours so the nightclub actually gets used for what it 's there for as normally once the all inclusive finishes people tend to begrudge paying for drinks so go back to there room so this is good that you don 't have to and people stay in there .
Just average
OK , so it 's an airport hotel , just functional etc. We got bumped to a next · day flight ( no frustration , though , so shouldn 't affect my hotel assessment ) , stayed here , but the room was rather underwhelming .
One bed with twin mattresses , nothing modern in the room , just everything very average .
Restaurant downstairs was quite nice , though .
Dana Beach is a top hotel !
In Dana beach is everything good , the food , the rooms , the people who are working there ! !
We already went 14 times to this hotel and we already booked again for april 2013 for 2 weeks !
It 's the best hotel in Hurghada for us ! ! !
Ilse And Danny from Belgium
The holiday was everything we 've hoped for
We cannot find anything to complain about .
Hotel was excellent en the staff was very friendly .
only remark maybe is that for families with little children the facilties ( playing ground ) is not available
I was there a week , view of our room was beautiful but our mini bar was empty just some cokes and juice and there was not an ash tray in our room.staff was so helpful but some of them was not kind , food was good but dishes and knifes , forks especially glasses were not clean and were too dirty.entertainment programme was good , specially live show but most of music was turkish not international although most of the guest was from another countries .
We reserved ultra all but drink was not variuos and If we wanted different drink we had to pay for it .
Samira , Iran
Nice hotel with friendly staff and a lot of food !
a nice Hotel with friendly staff.The beach is clean , but just reachable after 166 steps downstairs ( or upstairs ) .
There is also a lift but it is annoying to wait for it , because everyone want to use it and you have to queue for it , so we did body practice every day .
( After a while it is not that bad ! )
The staff was really nice and also the rooms were clean .
The food was ok. good offer , giant buffet ( in the morning AND in the evening ) , especially the deserts were very good .
For me and my friend it was the perfekt Hotel for our purpose to enjoy a week at the beach and do some trips to Kallithea or to Kassandria ( every Thursday there is a market and this is great fun and a nice alternation ; ) ) All in all we are satisfied .
Great value for money
My room seemed to be taken .
Because of renovation work probably my room was not fully ready .
But the receptionist immediately offered me an improved room with riverside view .
Great room , clean , quit .
Perfect stay !
After a business meeting in Paris , I lost my flight back due to the proverbial after · work traffic .
I looked for accomodation at the ariport and found Ibis Hotel Paris Charles de Gaulle Paris Nord 2 a reasonable one .
The price is ok , the rooms are clean and functional .
This is surely not a hotel to stay when you want to visit Paris , but is a choice to consider when you just want to spend a night and get fast to the airport first thing in the morning .
Staff can be friendly or not .
Restaurants are ok , but not outstanding .
Top hotel .
This year for the 4 time
we are staying in this hotel for a few years now .
Every time is a wonderfull holiday
In April we will be back for a very sunny relaxing week
Personal is very friendly en work very hard to please the people
Its a good Hotel with nice rooms .
We hade a bigger room with a place to relax and sit down .
We really liked that .
Service was good and friendly , the room was cleaned every day !
The only thing we could eat at the hotel was breakfast , which in my opinion was a little bit expensive .
Good , clean accommodation with friendly staff
Tulip Inn was a good basic hotel .
The room was fine and the food was excellent .
It was close to the Metro and therefore easy to get to the centre of Amsterdam .
Although some rennovation was taking place it was a quiet place to stay .
I understand that in the Ukraine the hotel standards are not the same as in other areas in the world and this hotel might be a good option in this category , but we did not like it .
If you are looking at the " budget " hotel and you don 't care much about the room size and the available facilities , then this hotel might be an option for you .
Donetsk is not a tourist destination and the choices are limited .
I did like the way they solved the food situation , you basically get a budget you can use in a canine like restaurant that was very good .
To expensive , bad quality
Location is fine but service is not good .
Took me hours to check in , although I had a reservation and also paid in advance .
Service desk is bad .
Tele and air condition out of order .
No fridge in 1 of the rooms .
Noise during the night from the elevator .
Breakfast was a disaster , uncomfortable chairs / tables , bad quality food , no diversity , cold tea / coffee .
Very Good services
All the sercices was very Good .
( restaurants , bars , spa , Pool , fitnes , staff very Good ) very Good GUEST RELATIONS staff .
Entertainment program was very Good .
A la carte restaurant steak House was in a very nice location on the golf field .
Aqua park is big and very nice .
Lovely hotel .
Stayed at hotel for a week in June & again in October .
Hotel is lovely , very clean & tidy .
Staff were lovely and willing to assist with anything they could help with .
Both times all inclusive , food was okay , got abit repetitive at times so opted to visit the sister hotel next door on a few occasions as there appeared to be more of a variety there also a few visits where payed to mcdonalds wich is situated only a 5 minute walk away .
On 1st visit in June there appeared to be hardly any English people at all staying in the hotel , mainly German & Russian , yet on our second stay , there were quite a few english families .
Only location
I was there with my friends in a 4 days vacation .
We wanted a private room for us " 8 persons " .
The Pension offered this room which was big enough to fit us .
The location of the Pension is PERFECT .. BEST LOCATION EVER .... but everything else is negative .. It is not clean , staff are not friendly at all , it is not safe .... I am not recommending it to anyone ...
Very bad hotel
There are mice in the hotel room .
All furniture is in very poor conditions .
However the location is very good. it is close to all attractions and amenities .
The size of room is reasonable , but floor , walls and ceiling are in very poor conditions .
The breakfast is very modest and the choice is very poor .
In overall I would not recommend this hotel .
It is really very basic .
A really enjoyable holiday
dana beach is a large complex with a lake running the entire length of the complex .
two boats are available to ferry guest to the beach if needed.although walking is not a problem .
room cleanliness was of a high standard and the hotel grounds were well kept and always being tended to .
food was was of a good quality and well presented in the five restaraunts .
i am british most other guests were german with some russian .
with a good mix of age groups .
we really enjoyed our stay this time as we did when staying in 2010 .
we would consider going back to dana beach as we found it to be a great chill out
holiday .
Comments on my stay at Club Hotel Dolphin
Room service needs to be improved and we experienced that some of the Linen provided are damaged .
Condition of the room is very poor and also it was not cleaned properly .
Attending for issues are ok .
Genuine country and people
No words for this country and its people .
If you really want a break from your current lifestyle , it 's a genuine and peaceful destination .
At the hotel , staff members were always smiling and helpful .
Very Upsale Hotel , In the Center of the City
The hotel is upscale and very expensive .
It is a really nice hotel in great condition and very easy to travel to anywhere in the city .
I walked mostly everywhere I wanted to go .
Numerous shopping and dining areas within walking distance .
Don 't go there , the only nice thing is the beach
I would never ever come back to this hotel even if they paid me. simply it 's not worth the money , let alone the 4 stars .
There are not enough seats for the guests in the restaurant , so for dinner you have to wait in a queue
A beautiful hotel , take time to explore !
The Room was cleaned daily to a high standard , Cold drinks were replinished daily .
On my son 's bithday the room was decorated by our cleaner with a cake and animal charaters made from towels this made his day !
We were all inclusive and although my son is extremely fussy eater he had no problems finding something to eat for all times of the day .
The first floor 24 hr bar was well run and no matter what time of day there was always a waiter on hand to serve .
Salem was one of our favorite waiters who always had a smile and nothing ever seemed to much trouble for him .
Very clean and fresh room !
This B & amp ; B was very clean and fresh .
The owners maintained the place very well .
Beddings were warm and comfortable .
Room was equipped with TV , radio , Kettle , Coffee maker , dvd player and a tv with so many channels .
Ample towels and toiletries were provided which many other B & amp ; B don 't usually provide enough .
Owners were very generous with the breakfast servings .
Alphons was very helpful in helping us with directions in the area as well as places to visit .
The only little problem was to us since we don 't travel light and the room is 2 floors up ...
Hotel was very nice , clean and well maintained .
However the food was cold , not enough crockery / cutlery etc in restaurants .
Piped music was so loud it made your ears sting !
In the bar areas there were plenty of tables but not enough tables so nowhere to sit .
The visitors were mainly Russian who were treated with respect , served straight away and generally took over everything .
They smoked everywhere which was not pleasant .
As we were a party of 6 British adults this did not go down very well .
We met the General Manager and pointed out all the faults to him · to say he was mortified is an understatement .
It can be a nice place
It 's not negative review .
I was there during some refurbishment works so it was not the best moment to be there .
Plus : really fresh orange juice at breakfast ( squeezed on demand )
Location : just crossing the roads there are plenty of very good restaurants at affordable prices .
You just cross the boulevar du Periferique and you are in zone 1 or public transportation .
30 min of underground and you are at Saint Michael .
As Ibis " Style " you get Accor points even during workdays
Minus
size of the room , really small small , no place to hang something more than two shirts .
Disappointed experience
Similar to all Steigenburger hotels of which I stayed , the hotel was clean and the staff professional .
Advised breakfast was included when I reseved the room from the airport Welcome Center , however since I reserved the room " from the airport " it was not , according to the desk clerk the next morning .
Danish vote
A super holiday · but : the staff did not understand much english .
A big and nice appartement · but the madrasses of the bed were awfull hard .
And · we stayed without any pension and the kitchenware were very deficient .
TV signal was not good and we missed a up to date flat screen .
finally we had to pay 20 Euro for internet for a week · that should be included .
But · a very relaxing stay with nice people and service in top .
A stay we always will remember with joy and happiness
Don 't go there , the only nice thing is the beach
I would never ever come back to this hotel even if they paid me. simply it 's not worth the money , let alone the 4 stars .
There are not enough seats for the guests in the restaurant , so for dinner you have to wait in a queue
Really lovely resort
The atmosphere and staff were wonderful .
Nothing was too much trouble .
The food was really nice they had a good range that catered for all tastes .
Fancy pyramid hotel
The hotel might at first be appealing due to it 's special architectual design and features .
However , the room quality and the service was quite bad and disappointing .
First off , they claimed to offer an upgrade but what they actually did was move us to a supposedly new building which was further away from the main hotel complex .
The room did not look very clean and the lighting was below standard .
Room amenities were below standard with no water heater and an very old television possibly from the stone age .
The free vouchers for meals and drinks turned out to be useless too because they could only be spent on specific restaurant which had a bad reputation in other online reviews ...
A very nice holiday with small faults
My wife and I were in these 2 weeks very well emotionally .
The hotel we very nice , not too big nor too small .
Some would have to change it , especially the rude staff that we noticed .
Otherwise , they are all trying very , very , very friendly .
The atmosphere is right , it 's very cozy .
Perhaps one should choose the audience something more international , mainly because there are very many Russians .
Melia Grand Hermitage is just awesome
Fantastic hotel · everything done to make your holiday perfect .
We had a lovely stay there and be definitely back soon !
Would highly recommend it !
Food was delicious , as well .. It is hard not to enjoy the great views down the beach from the exceptionally large private terrace assoiated with our suite .
Great Atmosphere & varieties of foods !
I have experienced in Linen change in the bath room of Villa which i staid , since the linen are not fresh on my entry to the room .
Thereafter , i have call up the room service & got it changed .
Other than the aforesaid , i have nothing to complain about Club Dolphin during my several visits .
Keep up di good work .
Prashanth
Hotel Titanic Beach Spa & Aqua Park
during my stay at titanic beach i found many different activities for my children and also for me and my husband .
the animation was amazing : ) w.g the welsh girl Stephanie was always around to speak to if we needed her .
the waiters in pirates ( 276 ) bar was funny and could speak good English .
the rooms were big and clean , the beach is well looked after but could do with less jelly fish Evan though they don 't sting , the pool is well looked after the food is ok we could eat but could be a little improved ........... all in all we had a brilliant time and we are looking to come back next year : ) thank you every one for such a brilliant time : )
Terrible service , very bad rooms , very bad manager
the worst hotel experience in my life , no hot water , shower equipment destroyed , no Wi · Fi in the room , personnel didn 't know the hotel restaurant / bar menu , no towels in the room and the manager didn 't care at all for the complaints
awful experience
Hotel and Villa Dievole was absolutely stunning .
The atmosphere was so relaxing with the gardens , walkways , old buildings and even the staff .
This was the most picturesque of Tuscany and I cannot wait until I can go back again .
You get what you pay for ...
We were traveling around the North of Spain for a couple of days and had decided to stay in Bilbao for 2 or 3 days .
We found this little hotel at an incredibly cheap price and decided to book it .
In addition to the price , the big advantadge is that the hotel is located verz close to the city center , and hence provides a prefect " base camp " .
Appart from that , you get an acommodation according to the price , that is : small dark room , old furniture , tiny bad and noise .
Every door that gets closed , every toilet that gets flushed , every single single conversation from everyone passing by your room .
All in all , that 's it , a very cheap accomodation that can be considered if you can cope with the noise .
Central location , very professional
This is a great hotel for location , very close to the main railway station and walking distance to the centre of town .
The actual neighbourhood is not great however , mostly betting shops and convenience stores .
The hotel is very secure however , with swipe card access to each floor .
The staff are profession if by the book .
As a gold member I enjoyed an upgrade to a very large room with lots of floor space .
The bathroom was well fitted but could have been bigger given the size of the room .
Also had one of those combined shampoo showergel wall units which is displeasing .
Breakfast was substantial and included .
The Sheraton Hotel Jumeriah is highly recommendable .
Everything was absolutely perfect .
The staff was absolutely wonderful , nothing was too much trouble for them .
They were helpful , and friendly .
I loved staying there , and have spoken very highly of this hotel to my friends and colleagues .
Should I return to Dubai again , I will certainly stay there again .
I have travelled a lot in my life , all around the world , staying at some of the world 's loveliest hotels , but never have I encountered a hotel with such staff , who go out of their way to make the guests enjoy their visit .
Delightful situation and the view of the canal could not have been better .
The rooms were clean , big and comfortable .
The dinner was excellent and the dining room staff made sure we had a table all to ourselves .
All of the staff that we met were both efficient and friendly .
This hotel does not deserve 4 * in my opinion , although in general most of the staff were very pleasant , the upper management were like british politicians , when you complained they did not give you an answer but changed the subject .
We tried NOT to eat in the buffet restaurant as the quality and choice of food was very limited , The reception area was clean and the lobby staff were very helpful , The house · keeping was basic but not impressive , The pool , bar & beach areas were kept tidy and the outdoor staff were pleasant. there were quite a lot of Russian guests there ( approx 85 % ) with a minority of British , French , swedish , German , Norwiegen & Egyptian .
My impressions are generally very good and I feel
very good according the price .. excellent sea.very friendly people. i would like to be again in that place. i will not forget the smilling faces of the emploeys of the hotel and how helpfull they were >
Great location , good hotel
The best about this hotel is its location .
The hotel itself looks a bit dated , reminding of the grand style of famous hotels in other world cities .
It is not run down or anything , it 's kept clean , but it 's just the style that is a bit dated .
In general , staff is attentive and helpful , and the stay was pleasant .
Food prices though are completely out of touch with Sofia reality , even in comparison with other similar hotels in the city .
But you are so close to restaurants and bars that there is really no reason to eat in .
I usually chose the citizen for my overnight layovers in AMS .
It ’s walking distance from the airport and the rooms , despite being small , are very practical for a one night layover .
Stayed one more last month and keep being a happy customer .
Mamlouk was great !
Mamlouk resort was great .
Especially Ahmed F. who worked in the Sultana Café .
He was really kind and service minded .
Sultana Café is really worth a visit .
Also the perfume store in the hotel .
Amir there is cool and nice and the perfumes is really worth it .
The bad things though were that the shopping center in the hotel were really bad .
The salesmen could take a no and they were kinda rude .
And then there were the salesmen who walked the poolarea .
They ignored the red flag that means " no salestalk " and were kinda rude .
But the whole experience was nice and worth it .
Terrible room
This is what we found in our room : cracked bathroom basin , chipped bath , dirty tiling round toilet area , black mould on tiling , rotten bathroom door from water damage , heavily stained and torn bed cover , no tea or coffee making facilities , very old and faulty TV .
Astonishingly , Thomsons rated this hotel as 4 · star .
I wouln 't use Thomsons ever again .
This is a great hotel , in beautiful Tuscan location .
For people who want some rest and relaxatio it is realy great .
The only minus ( for some people it might be a plus ) is the distance from firenze itself .
You need a car to get there .
everything was quite good , had a great time !
very warm sea , nice beach , animation team was always trying to entertain people , the hotel itself is a real 4star hotel , the rooms are big , nice staff
Melia Grand Hermitage ... hard to leave it !
Everything was unexpected in the good way as possible !
I got 5 days of maximum relax time .
I 'm from Romania , i love my country , but the bulgarians are better than us at tourism !
Congratulations ! ! !
Good location on Nevskii
Our room was on the second floor , with a view on Nevskii · view was great but noise a bit annoying .
The room was of decent size , but all in length , which isn 't the most convenient .
In addition to the large and comfortable bed , furniture included a desk and 2 seats .
Bathroom was nice and well equipped ( including a rubber duck !
)
Front desk wasn 't the best , quite slow for passport registration and clerk insisted that we pay up for a better room .
In · room breakfast was tasty and quite large , awesome .
