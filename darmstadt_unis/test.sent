This course was challenging , up-to-date , and the text by Daft and Mann complimented the course brilliantly .
Dr . Ellis gave wonderful replies and critiques to assignments that were submitted in reference to the assigned work .
I really learned a plethora of strategies , structures , and approaches businesses , non-profit , and public sectors use , which fostered a better understanding of the way corporations operate .
There are mixed reviews from students that have attended UMUC .
All I know is , the first class I took I liked and want to continue at UMUC because the quality of my degree discipline has been good and proven commendable so far .
University of Pheonix Online has provided a reliable classroom environment .
The material is challenging and learning environment is unique .
I am pleased with my overall experience with UOP . ------------------------------ To SEANOS : I am entering my final class for my Master of Science in Computer Information Systems with UOP .
I say that by the time you reach college , your social skills should already be developed and the focus should be on training you can actually use .
I am a firm believer in UOP and online learning .
Yes it is expensive , but you get what you pay for . . .
They get your money and then screw you out of a real education .
I made straight A's at UoP but the instructors I had for all my classes gave no feed back , no weekly grades(so you had no idea if you was actually learning the material correctly or not ) and financial couslor was a joke !
Their program for financial aide is screwed up ! ! ! AND I bet since you work at a hospital...you get employer repayment or at least half your tutition paid .
I took on UoP knowing full well the work load would be heavy , but it was going to be well worth it for accomplishing my goals .
To UpsetStudent : I do agree with you . . UoP only sees potential students as $$$$$ and their programs stink ! ! Force you to take classes that do not need to be taken for you field .
In my view the sole purpose of this institution is to collect ( exorbitant ) tuition .
Chats tended to be worthless drivel of some instructor simply reading out of a book or off slides .
Great school , excellent and thought provoking environment .
Courses are rigorous and challenging .
The ones who complain about UoP costing so much obviously never went to college anywhere before this .
Do you think UoP is in it for the joy ?
The classes offer real education and learning , but to get the most out of them you have to do the work .
Instructors vary in quality , but most are hard-working and want to help you succeed .
Only two or three per class will have the organization and determination to do well .
The adminstration of the school needs to get fired .
The school has no interest in customer satisfaction and does a superior job of recrutiment - but makes no committment to it's current learners who are often left to sort out the schools issues and pay ridiculous amounts of tuition .
This college robs them of the chance by convincing them they are accomplishing something while it promotes cheating and nonperformance .
This college should be stopped before they cause bigger debts for the government to have to get out of as well as turning out uneducated people with diplomas that mean NOTHING>
There are team papers for about 1/2 of the assignments and most of the students I worked with...I wonder how they graduated from high school .
Basically an easy " A " and every class .
It is a total joke of a school .
Most do not read the weekly chapters and have little to add to discussions .
There must be some kind of incentive for the teachers to give As .
I took accounting and was lost through out most of the course because I found it difficult to teach it to myself .
I am embarassed I go to UOP , but I came this far , I am going to finish .
With that said...for those who are questioning the validity of Capella , you will have to make your own mind up , but from my experience...it is no joke .
For those who have that mindset about Capella , you need to be put away for insanity ( or for frivolous motivations ) .
Something that I have learned about these people with pessimism towards Capella is that they are on tilt , have had their " wittle " feelings hurt by the process , or just are down right mad/ jealous that there are other options than the traditional B and M route ( of which my BS and MS are from B and M schools ) .
With all that praise said , and to show my non-partisanship towards Capella , I will state that I feel they over advertise on mediums such as the Internet , which brings down the " shine " in a sense .
Also , they do need to start putting forth some more stringent standards on acceptance...i.e...GMAT scores , etc .
I have been attending UOP for nearly two years , things apparently came to an end because the inability to handle issues in a timely manner .
My financial counselor is a liar and her manager is a coward .
I honestly have to say that UOP is in it for the money rather than the success of their students .
The University of Phoenix online is a joke .
The " Learning Team " element ( which is intrinsic to every class and accounts for 40-60% of your grade ) is nothing by a crapshoot .
Besides some pain in the butt financial aid issues that were resolved my education at DeVry has been great .
I learn more in an 8 week class at DeVry than probably my whole wasted education at my previous college .
But they do over a great education my classes have been challenging and the teachers educated .
I was suckered by a traditional college that did nothing to prepare me for the field I was studying ; DeVry on the other hand is actually preparing me for my intended field as well as educating me on other aspects meaning there is more than one field I could go into .
It is kind of overpriced , but it's still a great education and it cost only a little more than the traditional college that I wasted almost 2 years of my life at .
I will wait and see what classes they accept and if not enough i will not sign up for classes but so far I have had a very positive experience .
Get with it UMUC .
You make a lot of money off of us , so start giving back some quality .
Like UMUC , eArmy too seems like such a scam .
Great school , great education .
Mismanaged financial aid .
They have this wonderful EduCard program they try to sell you the problem in my experience is they got it wrong .
With DeVry you get high cost and not much in return .
