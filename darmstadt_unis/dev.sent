The drawbacks of the school is the poor customer service and relaxed admissions standards .
The relaxed admissions standards comes from the school being a for-profit school .
If you are interested in having a marketable degree from a school that is recognized across the nation then DeVry is the place for you .
This College was paid $2 million dollars by Household International , a predatory lender , to add a website that encourages debt among service members , and seems to disregard the Soldiers and Sailors Act which provides temporary relief to active duty service members .
It is unconscionable that UMUC is supposed to provide higher education to military personnel and , at the same time , is in partnership with a predatory lender that often mishandles payments , records , and disregards the law .
All tests are open book so that makes it easier .
It was apparent that the " Admissions Advisor " was really a salesman reading off of a script .
I read some poor reviews of CTU Online , and one that connected them with " American InterContinental University " which I confirmed ( via multiple websites ) is on probation .
There are reviews from students of CTU Online that like their experience .
Its not perfect , but it works for individuals who are motivated , hardworking and yet are busy with their careers .
It has both excellent and mediocre professors .
I go the seattle campus and in the CIS program and agree the that school is expensive .
However , for the courses that are critical for my career are hard core .
In general I have been pleased with UOP instruction and technical support is excellent , but their response times with the newsgroups are often unacceptable .
UOP needs to put some more money into infrastructure even if it has to take some away from their huge advertising budget .
Slow response times or no connectivity at all are becoming much too frequent as they push for more students without sufficiently upgrading infrastructure .
Spend your money and get your piece of worthless paper .
The equipment used in our courses was often out-of-date , as was the instructor .
Anyone can teach anything at UMUC seems to be the policy .
It's a quick degree for people who need one to claw there way to the top of a civil service-type job .
Capella University is a joke .
It's nothing more than a diploma mill that provides a substandard education .
Instructors ignore students and the administration is simply incompetent .
UOP sucks and lies too .
I would like to say that University of Phoenix is one of the best online programs out there .
The counselors are wonderful , the faculty overall was good , and very flexible .
The bottom line is that school is hard , and if you are not willing to do the work , it will be very frustrating .
I would like to encourage those that are serious about their education to look at University of Phoenix ! ! !
Besides , of course I have a Marxist Perspective when it comes to Capella .
The online experience is like no other !
They misrepresent their programs and then once enrolled , they change midstream .
STUDENTS BEWARE ! ! ! ! !
I am currently a student at UoP , and for every post on here there are some truth to them .
Period ! ! I am not paying $1300 for a course to have some semi-literate , low self-esteem person affect my grade .
UoP has to clean up its act and stop admitting everybody and their grand mama .
They have to establish minimum standards and maintain them .
I have had classes with students who are reading at elementary school level and I was so freaking embarrassed .
I have had conversations with faculty who have confided their frustrations with the quality of the students .
UoP is a departure from tradition and people are always scared of change .
Their recruiters make the following promises : we provide the textbooks as a part of the tuition , wonderful instructors , great online interactive learning environment , online library , online resource , but worst of all they tell you that the program is specifically for students that are completely new to programming .
It is impossible to be successful at this university or to learn everything .
There has been nothing but problems with the Learning Team garbage .
I am tired of waiting for people to submit work and wait until the day it is due .
I reccomend Capella to any highly motivated person who wants educational and personal advancement .
