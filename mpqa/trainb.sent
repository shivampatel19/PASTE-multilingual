britain ' s prescott pushes for kyoto pact backing
the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ratified even without u . s . support , british deputy prime minister john prescott told an international conference on business and the environment on friday .
prescott said that while the u . s . decision to reject the kyoto agreement is a cause for concern , pressure will be maintained on the bush administration to go further with its current voluntary emission - reduction targets .
prescott , britain ' s front man in pushing the accord , said the united states until recently was critical of the science that led to the kyoto pact but has now accepted it , and he remains optimistic that the goals of the united states and of other sign ##atory nations would converge .
named for the japanese city where it was approved , the pact was signed by 84 countries , including the united states and canada .
ratification could win support at an eu summit later this month in barcelona , spain .
the issue has pitted business groups , who claim the accord will hurt the global economy , against environmental ##ists , who warn of the dire effects from global warming such as higher ocean levels and destruction of various plants and animal species .
canada ' s environmental minister , david anderson , is under pressure from the country ' s energy producers to follow the u . s . position .
prescott came to anderson ' s support on friday , agreeing that financial figures quoted by kyoto opponents in canada about the potential damage to the canadian economy were " pure fiction . "
after putin ' s statement they rubbed their palms at length .
the military great power that towers over afghanistan has committed itself to overthrow the ruling taliban system , and has pledged to support the us " anti - terrorism military operation " now being prepared .
putin has exceeded the " positive neutrality policy " his country ( the soviet union at the time ) has pursued during the gulf war , and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable .
although these are sovereign states , and the final decision would have been in their hands , people familiar with the actual balance of power indicate that these states would have done nothing , had moscow wanted a different thing to happen .
accordingly , russia has joined the anti - terrorist coalition of the united states virtually without reservation .
putin has written the name of moscow on the registration page of the american side .
he wanted to become an ally , and that ' s what he has become .
but main stream russian military policy has been to keep a distance from america , the country that has been historically responsible for " educating " the taliban that had caused the demise of soviet occupation forces in afghanistan .
putin has no greater desire than to present to the west the che ##chen independence movement as a chapter of " international terror . "
he was criticized more than recognized for his policy .
in reality , putin asked for a free hand regarding che ##ch ##nia , some understanding , or even that the americans look the other way .
nevertheless , one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the united states called upon the che ##chen ##s to " un ##con ##ditional ##ly and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups , " and that they accept putin ' s offer to make peace .
in berlin , where he was the center of stormy celebration , he vin ##dicated for himself the deeper truth that may be seen behind terror .
he argued that had the west not continued to keep alive during the past several years the cold war stereo ##type of a threat from the east , but would have concentrated instead on terrorism , the common enemy , the twin towers of new york may not have collapsed .
feeling like a true ally , he was able to ask for a place for russia almost inc ##ons ##pic ##uously - in nato .
chavez told card ##oso he has no intention of seeking revenge against the military personnel who supported the failed attempt to remove him from office .
he suggests the definition of a series of priorities .
mala ##n critic ##izes the stance taken by multi ##lateral institutions like the im ##f , who are asking for reforms in argentina before the country can receive financial help .
the bank of spain governor did not want to detail what points argentina should deal with to expand its program .
this , the minister insists , is why " it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks , " referring to what the im ##f and some governments , like that of the united states , are asking .
mala ##n defend ##s a single currency for mer ##cos ##ur .
" we want to keep ali ##ght the flame of a single currency in the region in future , even if a distant one , " but until then , " there is the job of con ##sol ##ida ##ting the institutions in the political and institutional sphere , of productive restructuring and of modern ##izing the state " in six countries - brazil , argentina , uruguay , paraguay , chile and bolivia .
the minister says he is radically opposed to the idea of dollar ##izing the brazilian economy .
" we do not want to yield on brazil ' s having its own currency , its regional currency .
the minister believes that tension between brazil and argentina , resulting from the floating of the real in 1999 , will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opt ##ing for a floating exchange rate system .
the presidents of the six countries endorsed certain goals in relation to the debt , gdp , nominal deficit ##s as a proportion of the six countries ' gdp ##s , and maximum inflation .
the finance minister says he hopes , for mer ##cos ##ur , something similar to what happened in the eu : " an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down , like in some countries that de ##dicate themselves to lame ##nting , that see the difficulties as being ins ##ur ##mount ##able , and the problems as being un ##sol ##vable . "
mala ##n defend ##s a different posture : " to set aside the notion of cy ##nic ##ism , skepticism , that things will not work out , " and believe , like the europeans , that there is a future to be built by the mer ##cos ##ur countries and chile and bolivia , the associate members .
the 78 - year - old former guerrilla leader , who has governed since independence in 1980 , took another sw ##ipe at the former colonial power britain and other western nations , which he said have pre ##ju ##dge ##d the vote .
" they do n ' t want the president of zimbabwe to remain the president of zimbabwe , " he told reporters outside the school .
mug ##abe has faced widespread criticism and sanctions from the european union and the united states over alleged rights violations and manipulation of the election process .
the opposition movement for democratic change ( md ##c ) complained that the set - up was deliberately confusing in a pl ##oy to discourage the urban vote , which is thought to favor mug ##abe ' s challenger morgan ts ##van ##gi ##rai .
the jameson grill has been designed to be nothing but fun for you , your family , employees , and maybe even your neighbors .
earlier , the rainbow warrior sailed into doha on thursday morning , to challenge the w ##to to use the 4th ministerial conference to force the united states to commit to the kyoto protocol on climate change .
par ##ment ##ier said , on the one hand , the w ##to claims to support sustainable development and environmental protection and on the other , it does virtually nothing to protect the environment .
the kyoto protocol rejection by the us is in effect a hidden subsidy .
the w ##to claims that it wants to protect the environment .
then today , in doha , they must condemn the us for allowing a hidden subsidy , which according to the us governments own figures is equivalent to between $ 76 . 7 bn and $ 300 bn by 2010 .
par ##ment ##ier urged the delegates not to even discuss the possibility of a new round of trade negotiations unless the us this week in doha rat ##ifies the kyoto protocol .
he said green ##pe ##ace looked forward to work in partnership with developing countries to get the proper assessment of the impact of the w ##to instead of a new round of trade negotiations .
this is the only responsible course of action and it will be a historic success for doha and we want this meeting to be a success .
on board the rainbow warrior are nationalities from 18 countries , including witnesses from local communities who will testify to the adverse effects of w ##to global policies .
it gr ##ud ##gingly agreed to it only when some countries made concessions and made amendments to the draft .
as is feared by the whole world , preservation of the environment is becoming an awful ##ly grave and pressing problem that is linked to the existence of mankind .
this is the reason why many people of the world today are demanding that the world take concrete measures for protecting the environment , as they have come to realize its importance .
at the 1997 conference , representatives of many countries of the world supported and welcomed the adoption of the " kyoto protocol " as an epoch - making measure to curb the warming of the earth ' s surface and atmosphere .
emphasizing the significance of the adoption of the " kyoto protocol , " japan loudly trumpet ##ed at that time that the adoption of the protocol was " produced by the role " japan had played .
japan even called for working out practical measures to have it enter into force .
nonetheless , japan , changing its stand this time , opposed the draft regulations to put the " kyoto protocol " into force and even called for liquidation of the draft .
the united states , which has to do the most to implement the " kyoto protocol , " has come out opposing the draft regulations .
japan should be condemned by the world for that .
japan will be unable to escape stronger den ##unciation and more serious isolation from the world , if it continues to seek only its own profit and create stumbling blocks , and does not do what it is supposed to do to prevent the global warming and seek environmental preservation .
beijing , nov 8 ( af ##p ) - united nations human rights commissioner mary robinson began a visit to china on thursday with a warning to her hosts not to use the war against terror as an excuse for repression .
robinson told reporters in beijing she would raise individual cases of prisoners as well as her concerns about the " widespread " use of torture in china and the treatment of people in the regions of tibet and xinjiang .
afterwards , answering questions alongside co - sign ##atory vice foreign minister wang gu ##ang ##ya , she made it clear measures to crack down on terrorism should not be used to justify rights abuses .
the former irish president said she was concerned at " a worrying trend in a number of countries to use the excuse of combat ##ing terrorism to cl ##amp down on freedom of expression and legitimate dissent which is not violent " .
in anti - terror campaigns , " there must also be very clear boundaries and i am worried specifically about the ui ##gh ##ur population in xinjiang , i am worried about the situation in areas like tibet for example , which i wish to raise , " she said .
" i adopt a two pro ##nged approach .
one is to encourage this cooperation and the other is to express concerns about serious situations of human rights violations or short ##coming ##s , that i will also do . "
" if there are problems out there it is the issue of sep ##arat ##ists who want to undermine the situation , and a very important issue is the east turk ##est ##an terrorists and the dalai lama sep ##arat ##ist cl ##ique , " he told a press briefing .
however despite previous discussions " i have n ' t had as much progress on individual cases as i have wished to , " she added .
analysts have warned that however tough robinson ' s talk , international attention is probably too firmly focused on the anti - terror coalition , of which china is a part , to place much pressure on beijing over human rights .
" the ngos note with deep concern that the government has largely ignored su ##hak ##am ' s maiden report and its freedom of assembly report .
the ke ##sas report ir ##ked maha ##thi ##r after it found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti - government gathering along the ke ##sas highway on nov 5 , 2000 .
the ngos also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by rat ##ifying the international instruments of human rights , namely the international covenant on civil and political rights , the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights and the covenant against torture .
meanwhile , another concern raised was su ##hak ##am ' s independence following the appointment of former attorney - general abu tal ##ib ot ##hman as its new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners , an ##ua ##r za ##inal ab ##idi ##n , prof me ##hr ##un sir ##aj and dr salle ##h mo ##hd nor .
" this clearly undermine ##s the independence of the commission and will er ##ode public ' s confidence on it . "
on the other hand , the ngos said there is nothing in the public records which shows that abu tal ##ib was committed to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights .
claiming that there was " nothing personal " , the ngos said their concern was based on his defense of the 1987 ' ops lal ##ang ' where more than 100 people were detained under the isa [ internal security act ] .
the ngos also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners which has led to su ##hak ##am being made up mostly of retired civil servants .
" our concern is whether persons used to the role of policy implement ##ors can objective ##ly assess and critique executive policies which imp ##inge on human rights , " said ram ##das .
" when the bill ( su ##hak ##am act ) was table ##d in the parliament , our foreign affairs minister ( syed hamid alba ##r ) promised that this would be a positive development in protecting and promoting human rights in malaysia .
" we are now looking at su ##hak ##am as an institution to fulfill this promise , " he stressed .
in a related development , su ##hak ##am commissioner prof ham ##dan ad ##nan told malaysia ##kin ##i that he was disappointed with the boycott which he described as " unfair " .
he added the boycott could create the impression that the ngos were acting out of self interest and are not honest about champion ##ing human rights .
" this action shows that the ngos themselves do not acknowledge su ##hak ##am and do not want to work with us , " said ham ##dan .
no , i love this story .
and it was really beautiful and i really , really wanted one .
and the way we decided who got to wear it first , and this always kind of bothered me because i know kathy did this intentionally , she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than i am .
and we went to open kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and i think we would make the waitress ##es mad because we did n ' t have money to leave tips .
the legislative branch took part in this one ##up ##manship by issuing resolutions showing full allegiance to the radical right wing in israel .
even the most radical israeli hard ##liner ##s expressed the idea of the transfer more politely than the most senior , elected us bodies , which called on the palestinians to give up the west bank and look for what they called another homeland .
the flag ##rant attack , which condo ##lee ##zza rice launched on the palestinian leadership yesterday , demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth , which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations ' right to choose their leaders .
rice attacks the palestinian leadership , which was democratic ##ally elected , as testified by international observers , including former us presidents .
however , she refrain ##s from mentioning the elected israeli leadership , which moved the israeli army to occupy palestinian cities , destroy homes over the heads of their owners , arrest thousands of innocent people , and carry out what many legal and international humanitarian circles described as war crimes or bloody massacre ##s to say the least .
a prominent israeli official , shi ##m ' on pere ##s , said when his army moved into the jan ##in refugee camp : " i am afraid that a massacre may have been committed in the jan ##in camp . "
yet , the palestinian leadership is denounced and attacked while the israeli prime minister is praised .
the us president described him as a man of peace , thereby prompting the world ' s rid ##ic ##ule sometimes and den ##unciation at other times .
so , why do rice and the us administration launch campaigns against , and interfere in the affairs of , the palestinian leadership ?
the us national security adviser should have called for ending the occupation and di ##sman ##tling the settlements .
she knows for certain that this occupation and the settlements , which the israeli government refuses to remove , represent the only major obstacle to peace .
for its part , the palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace , not submission to plans aimed at writing off the palestinian issue and swallowing the west bank and gaza strip .
moreover , the aim of these plans is to make the palestinians yield to the di ##cta ##tes of the israeli - us alliance , which seeks a mimic resolution to the palestinian issue , which will per ##pet ##uate the occupation and facilitate the expansion of settlements .
no one , no matter who it is , has the right to med ##dle in the palestinian domestic affairs or to impose on the palestinian people a leadership favored by the us administration and the israeli government and tailored according to their mutual interests .
the calls in washington for democracy , transparency , and corruption - free system are only made to serve us plans , not out of concern about nations ' interests .
the first is that the current palestinian leadership represents the palestinian people ' s will , political convictions , and national aspirations .
the second fact is that if washington is interested in democratic reforms in order to combat terrorism as it says it is , it should pressure the israeli leadership to end its occupation of the palestinian territories and stop its rep ##ress ##ive practices against the palestinian people .
the united states turns a blind eye to these practices , pretending to forget that they violate human rights and are continuously denounced by the international community .
beijing , which regards the island as a way ##ward province to be reunited with the mainland by force if necessary , asked for an explanation on saturday of why bush had referred to taiwan as a country .
the english - language * * * taipei times * * * newspaper quoted bush as saying it was " important to recognize and to welcome both countries , both the republic of taiwan , and of course china , into the world trade organization . "
the taiwan issue has often caused rough patches in bilateral ties and u . s . arms sales to taiwan have angered beijing .
last month an editorial in the official * * * china daily * * * newspaper said beijing felt " betrayed " after a u . s . decision to allow taiwanese defense minister tang yi ##au - ming into the united states for talks with defense officials and warned of a set ##back in sino - u . s . ties .
he caution ##ed the people against the enemy and said that extra vi ##gil will certainly help in na ##bbing suspects .

he called for launching a coaching class for various competitive exams , as the area has no such facility .
expressing concern over d ##wind ##ling moral values in the society , the chief minister said that young ##sters must get inspiration from their glorious past and respect their parents and teachers .
he said due regard to elders and teachers is imperative for harmon ##ious society .

the rapid events and the changing of power in venezuela indicate that the puts ##chi ##sts did not enjoy a popular base and the venezuelan people as well as the military in the country did not end ##ors ##e the coup government of " pedro car ##mona " who was being supported by america .
america was the only country that came to the support of the puts ##chi ##sts immediately after they took power in venezuela .
america called the action of several military generals , who were supported by capitalist as well as bankers , as the victory of democracy in venezuela under circumstances where hugo chavez had come to power in 1988 through a popular process .
a number of observers believe that the reasons behind america ' s opposition to chavez and its support for venezuela under the generals who carried out the coup against him go back to the domestic and foreign plans and policies of chavez .
following a series of domestic reforms , especially in the agriculture , energy and banking sectors and describing communism and capitalism as futile , chavez caused the business leaders , bankers and capitalist to distance themselves from him and thus paved the way for their opposition to his power .
outside the borders of venezuela , chavez faced america ' s hostility .
they had been thinking about ways of ou ##sti ##ng chavez from the presidential palace in caracas .
ever since he came to power , chavez had refused to accept america ' s bid ##ing and had called on washington on numerous occasions to stop intervening in his country .
he also accused america of killing innocent children and people during the afghan war , met with " mo ' am ##mar q ##ad ##ha ##fi " and " saddam hose ##yn " , the presidents of libya and iraq and long - term enemies of washington , and had a very close relationship with the cuban leader " fide ##l castro " .
the combination of chavez ' s performance and policies brought on the wrath of american president bush to the extent that he failed to hide his anger during his visit to peru .
during his meetings with peruvian officials , bush spoke of america ' s dislike of chavez .
moreover , the american secretary of state " powell " also has recently announced in his annual report to the american congress that taking into account hugo chavez ' s closeness to countries that are not dependent on america , he is not considered to be a trust ##worthy pawn in the latin american region .
besides these instances of american hostility towards chavez , mention must be made of his oil policy within op ##ec .
the bush administration ' s support for the venezuelan puts ##chi ##sts is testament to this .
bush repeated his rejection of the 1997 kyoto protocol aimed at ##cu ##rbin ##g global warming , and pushed for the alternative he announced last week .
ko ##iz ##umi , meanwhile , called the new u . s . plan " a very constructive proposal , " but asked for more efforts from the united ##sta ##tes .
" it is for the u . s . to decide whether to take part in the protocol or not , but i hope we will continue with our efforts so we can move in the same direction , " said ko ##iz ##umi , who supports the kyoto protocol .
we ' d like to see further efforts on the part of the u . s . , " the japanese leader added .
bush rejected the kyoto pact last march , saying that it would hurt u . s . economic growth .
the u . s . president announced an alternative proposal last week , calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies in accordance with economic growth instead of mandatory reduction targets presented in the kyoto pact .
the proposal is criticized by environmental ##ists as ineffective for solving global warming and warn that under the plan u . s . greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise .
japan and the u . s . can cooperate over the development of new technologies in the field and that such technologies will help not ##on ##ly the environment but also economic development , they agreed .
tokyo ir ##ked by us stance on kyoto
but now , with president george bush saying the us will not rat ##ify the protocol - which was shaped in part to fit washington ' s concerns five years ago - the accord ' s ultimate effectiveness is in doubt , and many us allies are irritated .
for japan , a nation of nature - lovers , the shaping of the accord on their soil was a source of pride - and proof that they were still relevant players on the world stage .
realizing the accidental slight , the us later apologized for overlooking prime minister jun ##ichi ##ro ko ##iz ##umi ' s efforts - considered tremendous ##ly ambitious here - to alter the interpretation of japan ' s post - world war ii pac ##if ##ist constitution in order to dispatch warships for non ##comb ##at support .
during mr . bush ' s visit here last month , mr . ko ##iz ##umi gently bal ##ked at the president ' s proposed alternative to the kyoto agreement , saying that japan would " like to see further efforts " on the part of the us .
while there are no protesters in the streets , there is an air of ind ##ign ##ation here over washington ' s " do - it - our - way " decision on something that effects the whole globe .
from pulling out of kyoto - which is in the process of being ratified by the european union - to labeling iran , iraq , and north korea an " axis of evil " and prime targets in the next phase of the war , america ' s allies are seeing in the us a growing tendency to act first and consult later .
they fear that , because the us is for ##ging its own way , smaller nations that are expected to rat ##ify the kyoto protocol could start backing out .
not everyone in japan is upset with bush ' s alternative .
but the $ 40 - billion figure , far from being conceived to " fright ##en " canadians , is plucked straight from government documents .

at the ceremony , which was held in the presence of some security and government officials as well as a large number of foreign ambassadors and military attache ##s from 15 foreign countries , the participants praised those companies which emerged superior at the exhibition .
touching on the importance of modern technology in preventing and reducing crimes in society , par ##vin also thanked the active participation of local and foreign companies at iran ' s first international police and security equipment exhibition .
he also assessed the achievements of the exhibition as very useful and satisfactory , hoping that the police and security forces would be equipped with the latest and most modern technology so that they can ex ##ped ##ite their activities in their campaign against crimes .
pointing to the presence of inter ##pol officers and the representatives , ambassadors and military attache ##s from different countries , including russia , saudi arabia , slovakia and italy , par ##vin said despite the fact that it was the first exhibition of its kind in iran , it was extensively welcomed by many companies .
he also gave the news about the holding of a similar exhibition by iran and russia in moscow and hoped that the iranian companies would present their equipment at this exhibition .

the number of south asian ##s seeking political asylum in hong kong is on the rise following the us - led military campaign in afghanistan , it was reported wednesday .
the senior management of the hong kong government , however , was shocked by the surge and was worried that some people might use it as a means to remain in hong kong indefinitely , the report said .
i hope the measures adopted domestically will have the same effect as ad ##hering to the kyoto protocol , " said card ##oso . ( ab )
just cl ##ob ##bered , " said ul ##ric wei ##l , an analyst at wei ##l & associates who had once been high on the company .
he said the strength of the world - wide economy is suspect , and does n ' t see much revenue growth in the cards .
stanley ka ##o , director of mo ##fa ' s north american affairs department , made the remarks amid mounting concerns about the possibility that the united states could compromise taiwan ' s interests in exchange for mainland china ' s cooperation in the current us - led war on global terrorism .
ka ##o said us president george w . bush ' s trip to shanghai is mainly to attend the annual informal leadership meeting of the asia - pacific economic cooperation ( ape ##c ) forum to seek expansion of the anti - terrorism coalition .
prior to his departure for shanghai , bush said during his meeting with mainland chinese president jiang ze ##min , he will re ##af ##firm to jiang the us support for the " one china " policy as well as its desire to see a peaceful solution to all disputes between the two sides of the taiwan strait .
ka ##o said several senior bush administration officials , including secretary of state colin powell , has also made re ##ass ##urance ##s that the united states would not seek mainland china ' s support for the anti - terrorism campaign at the expense of taiwan .
" we believe in the sincerity of the united states in promising not to mix up its counter - terrorism drive with the taiwan strait issue , " ka ##o said , adding that relevant us officials have on many occasions re ##af ##firmed similar commitments to the roc .
noting that the united states has consistently attached great importance to asia - pacific regional stability and security , ka ##o said the robust us arms sales package to taiwan struck in april this year signifies that the united states is serious about security in the region .
against this backdrop , ka ##o said , the roc government is optimistic about defense cooperation with the united states .
opposition youths are ag ##itating to get guns to " shoot " president mug ##abe " out of office , " md ##c leader , mr morgan ts ##van ##gi ##rai said in south africa yesterday .
speaking in an address to the cape town press club , mr ts ##van ##gi ##rai , who is on a visit to south africa , was quoted by reuters as saying he was having to " rein in militants keen to fight president mug ##abe ' s rule " .
mr ts ##van ##gi ##rai endorsed a united states proposal for targeted sanctions against president mug ##abe and members of his government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruin ##ous mistake .
mr ts ##van ##gi ##rai called for international action to ensure a free and fair presidential election .
but he opposed any steps that could plunge the country deeper into a recession that has already pushed unemployment , inflation and interest rates above 60 percent .
that is why , as md ##c , we are reluctant at this stage to end ##ors ##e the sanctions option .
" however , we do support certain limitations on the villains of the crisis in zimbabwe , " he said .
mr ts ##van ##gi ##rai might face charges of contra ##ven ##ing the law and order maintenance act for allegedly threatening to violently remove president mug ##abe from power last year .
his trial was set to start at the high court in may but the case was referred to the high court after he challenged the legal ##ity of lo ##ma in the supreme court .
charges against the md ##c leader arose after he allegedly told a crowd at the party ' s first anniversary last year that " . . .
z ##vati ##cha ##da , what we would like to tell mug ##abe today is that . . . please go peacefully .
if you do n ' t want to go peacefully , we will remove you violently . "
the md ##c leader also alleged that the government was trying to provoke protests that could be used as an excuse to suspend democracy .
but analysts expressed concern that the md ##c leader is " flirting with mercenaries in south africa " .
but the eu is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce us emissions .
the eu is concerned about the purely voluntary nature of the actions proposed .
the eu welcome ##s the fact that the bush administration has now completed its policy review and has put forward what the us intends to do in terms of domestic climate change policy .
the eu will continue on its current path of emission reduction and is optimistic that other major players , notably japan and russia , will join us in these efforts .
" on the basis of observations made during the voting , verification and counting process on the ground and objective realities , the o ##au observer team wishes to state that in general the elections were transparent , credible , free and fair , " the team ' s leader gertrude mon ##gel ##la said .
in his cong ##rat ##ulation message to his zimbabwe ##an counterpart robert mug ##abe , tanzania ##n president benjamin mk ##apa calls him a champion of democracy .
" i am pleased to send my warm congratulations on the renewed and the deserved presidential mandate the people of zimbabwe have given you , " mk ##apa said .
kenyan president daniel ara ##p moi cong ##rat ##ulated mug ##abe on his reelection , saying his victory and that of his za ##nu - p ##f party was " testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of zimbabwe hold in you " .
the sad ##c council of ministers in a statement appeals to the people of zimbabwe to accept the results .
the south african government in a statement welcome ##s the fact that the actual elections and subsequent processes have proceeded without any significant conflict among the participants .
however , zimbabwe ' s presidential election was condemned by some western countries .
us assistant secretary for african affairs walter kan ##stein ##er in a statement called zimbabwe ' s election flawed , saying that the us would consider further sanctions against mug ##abe and his government .
he also said the european union will consider tough ##ening sanctions on the mug ##abe regime when foreign ministers meet ahead of the barcelona summit on friday and saturday .
islamabad , march 18 , ir ##na - central leader of pakistan people party ( pp ##p ) and former provincial minister of north - west frontier province ( nw ##fp ) se ##yed q ##ama ##r abbas has rejected us state department report on human rights in iran and other countries , saying america has no right to make such a report as it is itself the viola ##tor of human rights .
it den ##oun ##ces human rights violation but supports israel for per ##ishing the muslims in palestine and lebanon , " abbas criticized .
however , he hoped that the people of the world can no more be kept in dark .
this weekend , the agency bad ##e farewell to administrator daniel gold ##in , who resigned after 10 years in office - an agency record .
president bush has nominated sean o ' ke ##efe , deputy director of the white house ' s office of management and budget , to replace him .
but the agency ' s credibility has come under fire in manned space ##flight - especially the international space station , now completing its first year of full - time crews .
future us modules were red - pencil ##ed .
and this month , a task force on the project ' s budget concluded that nasa ' s cost estimate for finishing the " core " station between 2002 and 2008 " is not credible . "
to cut the station ' s scope , they argue , violate ##s international agreements and would essentially close off international use of the station .
o ' ke ##efe ' s appointment " is a clear message from the administration : nasa has to clean up its act before we can talk about the neat stuff we ' d like to see nasa do , " says patricia das ##ch of the national space society .
many fear violence after zimbabwe vote
but a surge in political violence and accusations that the governing party changed election laws to rig the vote have fan ##ned widespread concerns among zimbabwe ##ans , election monitors and foreign diplomats that neither political party nor their supporters are prepared to accept the final tally .
in a television interview broadcast the other day , did ##ym ##us mu ##tas ##a , a spokesman for mug ##abe ' s ruling za ##nu - p ##f party , said that he and other veterans of the country ' s independence war found the prospect of a ts ##van ##gi ##rai government into ##ler ##able .
" under these circumstances , if there were to be a coup , we would support it very definitely . "
state department officials this week accused mug ##abe ' s government of numerous human rights violations during the election campaign , an all ##ega ##tion ve ##hem ##ently denied by za ##nu - p ##f officials .
many zimbabwe ##ans see this weekend ' s election as a contest between im ##movable forces : a 78 - year - old auto ##crat desperate to remain in power and an opposition party dominated by restless young citizens weary of government corruption , food shortages and unemployment .
" but if the md ##c wins , i believe mug ##abe will announce martial law , throw ts ##van ##gi ##rai in jail for plotting to kill him and send the army into the streets . "
government officials last month charged ts ##van ##gi ##rai and two other officials of his party with high treason for allegedly plotting to assassinate mug ##abe .
that charge is based largely on a heavily edited video ##ta ##pe in which ts ##van ##gi ##rai refers to the " elimination " of mug ##abe .
za ##nu - p ##f officials have told election observers that they intend to increase the number of polling stations in rural areas believed to be their stronghold ##s and reduce the number of stations in urban areas , where there is strong support for the opposition .
observers say that could produce long voting lines and discourage some ts ##van ##gi ##rai supporters from casting ballots .
u . s . and other foreign banks , telecommunications , transport and energy companies are expected collectively to lose billions of dollars if law ##makers approve president eduardo du ##hal ##de ' s controversial economic package .
presidential spokesman eduardo ama ##de ##o said du ##hal ##de was stunned by the intense efforts to reverse the package .
the economic package nonetheless was passed by argentina ' s lower house late saturday night and is expected to gain easy passage through the senate today .
the companies are worried by du ##hal ##de ' s proposal to dev ##al ##ue the pe ##so and scrap a policy known as convert ##ibility that kept the pe ##so ' s worth the same as a u . s . dollar .
many political analysts fear a return to street violence when the dev ##al ##uation measure passes and companies seek to avoid losses by raising prices for food and medicine .
they want the dollar value of debt to remain constant , no matter what the dev ##al ##uation of the pe ##so .
du ##hal ##de does not agree and has resisted the lobbying , his aide ##s said .
they fear that if argentina can break promises made in contracts , other nations may try to do the same in less dire times .
talking to ir ##na , iv ##ash ##ev expressed regrets over the fact that the people in some parts of the world are indifferent toward the expansion ##ist policies of the united states and do not proceed to condemn them .
he strongly criticized the us war - mon ##ger ##ing actions and tactics and said the us war - mon ##ger ##ing has posed serious threats to the world .
iv ##ash ##ev further said russia is to develop its relations with the muslim nations as well as china and india .
he said the us officials claim as for the countries described as " parts of an axis of evil " are " un ##founded " and the us claims in this connection are " sheer lies " .
reacting to the threats launched by the us president george w . bush against iran he condemned the united states expansion ##ist policies .
us president george w . bush had in his state of the union address termed iran , iraq and north korea as " axis of evil " and accused them of attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction .
iv ##ash ##ev further said the united states is after gaining superiority over russia ' s nuclear capabilities and initiating an anti - missile defense system by the united states shows that country ' s intentions .
he said the united states is after imposing its expansion ##ists policies under the pre ##text of the fight against terrorism .

today the council of eu environment ministers adopted the commission ' s proposal for a decision to rat ##ify the kyoto protocol .
the european commission strongly welcome ##s this decision .
by taking this decision , the eu has re ##af ##firmed its commitment to pursuing multi ##lateral solutions to issues of global concern .
the eu continues to call for the united states to participate in the global framework for addressing climate change .
i am very pleased that the council has now approved the kyoto protocol thus enabling the eu to proceed with its ratification .
i am confident that member states will take the necessary steps in order to allow for a simultaneous ratification together with the european community before 1 june 2002 .
i urge our partners both in the developed and in the developing countries to also rat ##ify the kyoto protocol soon .
we want the protocol to enter into force before the world summit on sustainable development this summer . "
we all know that even the targets in the kyoto protocol are only a first step if we want to prevent the severe consequences that climate change could have . "
i am convinced that improving the environment through technological progress can actually enhance our competitive ##ness and economic growth .
the commissioner also stated that she was grateful for the strong support received from the european parliament to secure timely eu ratification , and pleased with the confirmation by the candidate countries that they are on track to rat ##ify .
the commissioner finally welcomed indications by japan , new zealand and norway that they are preparing for ratification , and strongly called on others , notably russia , to do the same .
we continue to urge the united states to return to the kyoto process . "
the commissioner concluded by stress ##ing the need for further eu emission reduction measures : " the european commission has already proposed measures to reduce emissions at the lowest economic cost , including an ec - wide emissions trading scheme to begin in 2005 .

with regard to the economic recovery on the other hand , the president announced his full support for the prime minister ' s structural reform and measures to fight def ##lation .

at a joint news conference held after the summit talks , the prime minister announced his understanding and approval of the president ' s statement designed to deal with the " axis of evil . "
saying that " all options are on the table " to deal with the " axis of evil , " the president also stated at the summit talks that he would " seek a peaceful settlement . "
ever since the president announced the " axis of evil " statement in january , iran , iraq , north korea have been trying hard , out of the fear of possible confrontation with the united states , to deny their involvement in terrorism or proliferation of mass destruction weapons .
to tighten the no ##ose around the " axis of evil , " the japanese government will seek understanding and cooperation from european countries that are critical of the president .

it ' s been almost a year since the taliban blew up those monumental 1 , 500 - year - old sandstone statues in north ##cent ##ral afghanistan , at which time the only way for the rest of us to handle the insult to human sen ##si ##bilities was to em ##ulate the ga ##uta ##ma buddha himself , and prof ##ess relief .
which , one suppose ##s , was indeed the motivation of those who blew away those statues to leave two giant holes in the afghan landscape , in the process paying un ##thi ##nk ##ing tribute to some of the buddha ' s subtle ##st and most profound teachings on the nature of imp ##erman ##ence and the per ##ils of del ##usion .
which was most disturbing of all , because such was the very sin that rocket was supposedly intended to ex ##pu ##nge .

as israeli tanks push their way into one palestinian population center after another it has become more and more difficult to guess what political objectives might be driving prime minister ariel sharon .
he says he wants to destroy the " infrastructure " behind the suicide attacks against the israelis .
we can understand this as an immediate military objective , but nothing will be achieved by the operation politically .
in the past week , the united states has taken a stand in support of the saudi arabian peace plan .
in the united nations , it supported [ a call for ] the removal of israeli troops from the cities in the occupied areas .
nevertheless , in his subsequent remarks , bush encouraged sharon to continue .
the cat ##egorical moral condemnation of terrorism is self - evident , but this will not free israel from the problem it faces .
one would think that no politically pr ##ude ##nt israeli could support either of them .
by supporting sharon ' s ir ##res ##pon ##sible saber rattling , washington places strains on its relations with the arab countries and needles ##sl ##y puts off a settlement , in which it must some day play the role of mid ##wife .

the white house haste ##ned to describe the bush plan as " the most au ##da ##cious program in american history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions . "
but environmental ##ists immediately attacked this us proposal .
presented thursday 14 february by president george w . bush , this alternative plan for slowing down global warming moves away from the binding measures of implementation of the kyoto protocol , recently approved by more than 170 countries in mar ##rak ##ech , but rejected in march 2001 by president bush , who deemed it harmful to the us economy and rep ##ro ##ache ##d it for imposing constraints on industrial ##ized countries only .
it advocates a vol ##unt ##aris ##t approach to the fight against global warming by directly linking the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction to us economic growth .
to encourage industry and consumers to demonstrate environmental public spirited ##ness mr . bush proposes tax incentives of $ 4 . 6 billion for the adoption of renewable sources of energy .
mr . bush calls for india and china to act
the us president asserted , moreover , his determination to win developing countries over to his plan , stating that the us approach would give them a " yards ##tick for progress on climate changes which recognizes their right to economic development . "
he asserted , in an all ##usion to the binding objectives of the kyoto protocol , that it would be " un ##just and counter ##pro ##ductive to condemn developing countries to weak or even none ##xi ##stan ##t economic growth by insisting that they adopt un ##real ##istic greenhouse gas reduction targets . "
" but i have the intention of working with nations , particularly developing nations , to convince them that a better approach exists , " he said .
president george w . bush considered , moreover , that it would be " ir ##res ##pon ##sible " not to ask india and china to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .
the white house haste ##ned to describe the bush plan as " the most au ##da ##cious program in american history aiming at reducing power station gas emissions , " considering that it would be possible to save the administration up to $ 1 billion , compared to the costs that binding rules would lead to .

the iranian president also expressed the hope that with the return of president chavez the venezuelan government would be able to achieve its ex ##al ##ted objectives with the support of the people .
referring to the objective of those who were behind the military coup in venezuela , chavez said they w ##wan ##ted to have venezuela come out from the organization of the petroleum export ##ing countries ( op ##ec ) and therefore tried to produce more oil in order to undermine the organization .
president chavez thanked president k ##hat ##ami for his telephone call and wished success for the iranian government and nation .
the two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet in the near future .
iran , sunday last week , sent congratulations to venezuela on hearing of the return of the rule of law and reins ##tate ##ment of the legitimate government of president chavez after the two - day military collapsed .
on saturday it condemned the the ou ##ster of the democratic ##ally elected president of venezuela , saying , " resort ##ing to a coup and the use of force is not an acceptable method to bring about political change and the method is not in conform ##ity with the norms of present human society . "
chavez , whose mandate was due to end in 2006 , was forced out of office by the country ' s armed forces who blamed him for the deaths of 15 people during demonstrations in the streets of central caracas against an opposition protest which later became violent .
chavez is a staunch supporter of oil production cuts in order to boost prices in the world market .
chatter ##box feels that the wall street journal editorial page ' s coverage of juan ##ita broad ##drick ' s rape charges against bill clinton ( see " proving rape , " " more proving rape , " as well as michael kin ##sley ' s " read ##me " column in the current issue ) cries out for the introduction of the scientific method into the usually mu ##sh ##y business of assessing press responsibility .

by comparison , respect for the kyoto protocol requires the eu to reduce its emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 , japan by 6 percent , and the united states by 7 percent , a figure accepted by president clinton in 1997 .
in its last report , the ip ##cc [ inter ##go ##vern ##mental panel on climate change ] called for rapid and decisive action to at least ave ##rt the most serious consequences of climate change .
at our ins ##ti ##gation , on 4 march eu environment ministers therefore called on the united states to " assume its responsibilities under the framework agreement on climate change , " that is to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels and strengthen domestic actions to bring them into line with the level of effort accepted by the industrial countries in application of the kyoto protocol .
if the effects of climate change were not so devastating and our action were to be guided by economic competition , we europeans could welcome the fact that the united states is not committing itself to an ambitious climate protection program , in so far as the technologies in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy are the technologies of the future .
we hope that the united states will come to realize that an active climate protection policy is not only necessary for environmental policy but is also an excellent opportunity to modern ##ize industrial society .
as for evil , it is a term used by former president reagan to describe the soviet union , although its evil was self - destructive , causing the country to collapse from within .
its name was only mentioned in the axis of evil to remove suspicion around the united states ' hostility to islam .
this leaves iraq , which the washington circles want to ant ##ago ##ni ##ze and to go to war with .
the government on monday announced its position on u . s . president george w . bush ' s new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions that he wants discussed internationally along with the kyoto protocol , an international treaty adopted in 1997 to control greenhouse gas emissions .
the ministry of foreign affairs and trade said in a statement that " the government of the republic of korea appreciate ##s continued interest shown by the government of the united states in climate change and their efforts in presenting on february 14 a new initiative to address this issue which is one of the greatest challenges human ##kind faces in the 21st century . "
the u . s . administration led by president george w . bush rejected the protocol early last year and recently announced a new policy on climate change which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to gross domestic product or economic activities .
us human rights report invites sc ##orn
washington ' s kid glove treatment of its so - called allies such as saudi arabia and pakistan came up for with ##ering scrutiny at a briefing to release the 2001 country reports on human rights practices , an annual administrative exercise mandated by the congress that many feel has increasingly become a meaningless ritual .
the report on india , for instance , is more than 100 pages long and pains ##taking ##ly lists incidents of rights violation across the country both by the government and terrorist , militant , and sub ##vers ##ive groups .
the us has shown no inclination to punish allies it bank ##roll ##s such as egypt and turkey while be ##rating countries less relevant to it .
q : lo ##rne , i want to follow up on saudi arabia .
i ' m a little bit surprised by your g ##lib answer .
we are talking to the saudi government about how to do that , and we are going to encourage others in the muslim world , in the arab world , who are trying to make their societies more democratic .

the u . s . state department released a human rights report on zimbabwe monday that accused the government of extra ##ju ##dic ##ial killings , under ##mini ##ng the independence of the judiciary and wa ##ging a " systematic campaign of violence targeting supporters and potential supporters of the opposition . "
in his speech on monday , mug ##abe thanked african leaders for refusing to buckle to pressure to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth of britain and its former territories at a summit of the 54 - nation grouping in australia .
britain , australia , canada and new zealand demanded the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth to protest state - sponsored violence and human rights abuses against the opposition .
this is the issue we would want our african brothers to have understood , " he said .
african leaders closed ranks at the commonwealth summit out of fear for their own power , he said .
the state - run herald newspaper , a government mouth ##piece , said tuesday british prime minister tony blair had showed personal arrogance , an obsession with mug ##abe and " the shallow ##ness of his commitment to democracy . "
the opposition accuse ##s the government of using violence , intimidation and new security laws to cow its voters and to prevent it from effectively campaigning .
foreign governments have pressed mug ##abe to restore the rule of law .
that angela mer ##kel , the chair ##woman of the christian democratic union , wanted the job had long been an open secret , although no one but she knew how far she was prepared to go .
but it was the uncertainty with which her rival , bavarian premier edmund st ##oi ##ber of the christian social union , the cd ##u ' s bavarian sister party , also sh ##roud ##ed himself that made the question of who would lead the union parties into the 22 september elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent gerhard sc ##hr ##oed ##er , so exciting .
mr . st ##oi ##ber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the cd ##u in an election that once looked impossible to win , through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of ms . mer ##kel and her party , to his willingness to take her on in a di ##vis ##ive vote if necessary .
mr . st ##oi ##ber carefully tread the path to the candidacy , spurred on by many and rein ##ed in by others .
mr . st ##oi ##ber seized it once the cd ##u made clear that it preferred him to its own chair ##woman .
that has always been the basic premise for a cs ##u chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party .
rather than force himself on the cd ##u , he waited to be called .
the cd ##u chose him because it believes in victory .
the union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign .
bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the ad ##vers ##aria ##l us position toward the three countries that , according to washington ' s claim , still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons .
as reminder , former us president ronald reagan used to call the soviet union " the evil empire . "
he claims that he belongs to the good side and whoever is on the other side is the evil that must be destroyed or at least deserves condemnation .
it is not enough that he sees those countries as evil , he wants his allies to feel the same way about them as well .
for the countries that regard the three countries as friends or not evil , they are considered to be enemies of the united states .
foreign policy was an issue that he never wanted to deal with before .
many believed that bush was naive about foreign affairs .
it does not matter where in the world , he will vigorously hunt terrorists down if they are perceived to seek to target the united states .
although the us role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser , the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are the groups that are regarded as enemies of the united states .
whether a country agrees with and regardless of how it views the us policy , the united states is taking the direction that emphasizes its national security and confrontation with the countries that washington regards as enemies .
the us naming of north korea may ann ##oy china , given its assistance to the united states in the war in afghanistan .
if he wants to look for a comparison , maybe he would find one in the likewise thwarted coup by colonel pedro car ##uj ##o against jose maria vargas .
comparing it with 19 april 1810 is another armed coup and must be rejected with all determination by the academies and by those who in one way or another must preserve our historical legacy from adult ##eration or dec ##eit ##ful use .
there were numerous deaths , and no one can feel proud of the consequences .
4 february was such a failure that chavez , even though it pained him , had to accept democratic methods to reach power .
that was what happened in 1998 , and still today , chavez gives constant demonstrations of discontent and irritation at having been democratic ##ally elected .
he has to respect the democratic rules of the game , the freedom of expression that causes him so many nightmares , the presence of the fundamental institutions of the nation whose right to exist he denies .
he wants to disguise the failed date of 4 february to create the collective illusion of a military victory , which would permit him to govern us from mira ##fl ##ores as if he really had reached power that day .
this was not the case , and the venezuelan people rejected him as a coup participant .
mas ##ire said this week he was determined to " ensure that people from all corners of the country are allowed to express their views " , adding that he wanted to avoid a " superficial " exercise .
the conflict in the former za ##ire broke out when rebels backed by laurent ka ##bil ##a ' s er ##st ##while allies rwanda and uganda launched an insurgency in august 1998 .
the det ##hr ##oning of chavez by the americans is a message that di ##so ##bey ##ing uncle sam would have cat ##ac ##ly ##sm ##ic consequences .
the us had repeatedly asked chavez and the venezuelan government to increase the level of their oil output as well as exports .
however , chavez who is known for his ala fide ##l castro left - leaning anti - american philosophy had on a number of occasions re ##bu ##ffed us requests for more oil exports .
in direct response , the americans , who preach democracy to the entire planet , recognizing that they could no longer tolerate someone like chavez reverted to their old bullying and dictator ##ial tactics and arranged for an army coup by several av ##owed pro - american generals , who managed to remove chavez from power in a few short hours .
the fall of hugo chavez in caracas is a crystal - clear message and warning by the us to anyone in the world who is contemplating to use oil as a political tool in the future .

chen also expressed hope that the united states will negotiate with taiwan to sign a free trade zone agreement between the two countries so as to help taiwan ' s internal ##ization and to give it more international responsibility .
he also expressed gratitude and admiration to the united states for its firm support for taiwan , especially in maintaining the security of the taiwan strait and peace in the asia - pacific region .
touching on taiwan ' s w ##to entry , chen said taiwan could not have smoothly entered the w ##to if the united states government and congress did not render their firm support to taiwan ' s bid for membership .

there were fears of a violent reaction from ts ##van ##gi ##rai ' s supporters , and security forces were put on high alert and police put up road blocks on approach roads to the capital hara ##re .
australia said it feared violence if voters thought the election had been stolen .
ts ##van ##gi ##rai , saying mug ##abe has destroyed the economy of the once prosperous nation , accused the president of systematically stealing the election to hide his deep unpopular ##ity with voters , reuters reported .
mug ##abe ' s government has dismissed criticism of the poll , which information minister jonathan mo ##yo called " exemplary " .
western countries queue ##d up to condemn the election in which the 78 - year - old president faced his first real challenge .
the united states , condemning the reduction of polling stations in opposition urban stronghold ##s , said the election was " seriously flawed " and riddle ##d with irregularities .
australia and britain led an unsuccessful call for commonwealth sanctions against mug ##abe before the election .
new zealand said on wednesday it was ready to impose sanctions against zimbabwe if the commonwealth decided not to suspend the country after the vote .
u . s . refuses to recognize mug ##abe government
the venezuelan experience during the past few days showed that regimes that are based on the votes and support of the masses and adopt relatively independent policies toward the big powers and especially america are not favored by the american leadership .
the americans ' hasty and immediate support for the coup shows that the americans are in no way in favor of national and independent rules coming to power .
also , the venezuelan president ' s return to power once again showed that if rulers are endorsed and supported by the people , the people ' s determination can affect decisions and that the people ' s presence on the scene can prevent rules and decisions with which they totally disagree .
we have good relations with venezuela , and there was no reason for us to be satisfied in any way with the overthrow the rule there , especially when the venezuelan regime ' s policies enjoy the extensive support of the venezuelan people and when there are points un its independent policies on oil that converge with our policies and have been positively assessed by the islamic republic of iran .
but undoubtedly there are basic doubts that exist about the coup and america ' s immediate support , and what springs to mind is the great possibility of some countries ' intervention in venezuela ' s domestic affairs .
london , march 19 ( af ##p ) - the commonwealth suspended zimbabwe for one year on tuesday , taking action against the regime of president robert mug ##abe a week after controversial elections returned him to power .
the surprise decision comes after the 54 - nation group failed to reach agreement on sanctions against hara ##re before the voting , when african leaders rallied around the anti - colonial ##ist mug ##abe , who has held power since independence from britain in 1980 .
the decision , taken by a three - way panel of howard and presidents tha ##bo mbe ##ki of south africa and ol ##use ##gun ob ##asa ##n ##jo of nigeria , follows a damn ##ing report on the march 9 - 11 vote by commonwealth observers .
zimbabwe ' s information minister jonathan mo ##yo immediately blasted the decision to lump his nation in with pakistan , which is also currently suspended from the commonwealth .
a spokesman for british prime minister tony blair said : " he clearly welcome ##s the decision by the commonwealth tr ##oi ##ka and believes that it is absolutely the right thing to do . "
foreign secretary jack straw also praised the decision , saying that " the message could not be clearer . "
new zealand foreign affairs minister phil go ##ff welcomed the commonwealth ' s suspension of zimbabwe but said new zealand was likely to impose sanctions anyway .
go ##ff said that while he welcomed the suspension , it appeared it had been done reluctantly .
the panel had been expected to def ##er or reject calls for zimbabwe ' s suspension after mbe ##ki and ob ##asa ##n ##jo held talks monday with mug ##abe and defeated opposition leader morgan ts ##van ##gi ##rai , and apparently proposed to media ##te in talks between the two sides .
most international observer groups have condemned the conduct of the poll , as have many western governments , notably britain and the united states .
the land reforms have been marred by political violence led by liberation war veterans who support mug ##abe .
when the imam ( may god be satisfied with him ) issued the fat ##wa against salman rush ##die for insulting the prophet ( peace be upon him ) and the holy ko ##ran , the countries that are so - called supporters of human rights protested against the fat ##wa .
by clarify ##ing the imam ' s edict the islamic republic of iran made the people of the world understand that insulting the prophet was in fact violating the rights of millions of people throughout the world .
now the united states has issued an assassination order against millions of human beings without having any proof , reason or documentation .
the only reason for this would be opposition to the united states .
if the european countries were honest in the withdrawal of their ambassadors from iran , blaming iran for violating human rights , then they should recall their ambassadors from the united states .
the united states thinks that it can silence the justice - seeking cries of the peoples of the world with the sound of explosions from 7 - ton bombs and it thinks that it can justify its own inhuman behavior in the shadow of this noise .
africa end ##ors ##es mug ##abe victory , the west condemn ##s it
african observers generally approved of his victory , while western governments denounced it .
the south african observer team blamed the long lines of voters unable to vote despite waiting many hours on " administrative oversight ##s " , a description that drew audible laughter from journalists and diplomats attending their press conference in the capital , hara ##re on wednesday .
president daniel ara ##p moi of kenya cong ##rat ##ulated mug ##abe , calling his victory " testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of zimbabwe hold in you . "
that position chimed closely with views expressed by the main zimbabwe ##an monitoring group , the zimbabwe election support network which had 400 observers monitoring the poll and have been heavily critical .
mug ##abe ' s main challenger , morgan ts ##van ##gi ##rai of the movement for democratic change , has rejected the outcome of the presidential poll .
ts ##van ##gi ##rai warned that his di ##sen ##fra ##nch ##ised supporters were " see ##thing " but imp ##lore ##d them to stay calm .
the government has rejected all criticism , describing the election as " exemplary , free , fair and peaceful . "
western governments are lining up to condemn the mug ##abe government , while the african bloc appears to have opted for solidarity in support of mug ##abe .
jack straw , the foreign secretary of the former colonial power , britain , which is locked in a verbal war with mug ##abe , said the zimbabwe ##an head of state was bent on achieving " one goal , power at all costs .
u . s . president george bush added his voice on wednesday night , cat ##egorical ##ly rejecting zimbabwe ' s presidential poll .
" we do not recognize the outcome of the election because we think it ' s flawed .
bush ' s secretary of state , colin powell , earlier concluded : " mr mug ##abe may claim victory , but not democratic legitimacy . "
australia , which with south africa and nigeria has been mandated to report on the zimbabwe presidential poll to the commonwealth , was equally critical .
" if the people of zimbabwe have a sense that they have been cheated through the election process , it is possible that some could resort to violence , " said the foreign minister , alexander down ##er .
the united nations ' secretary - general , ko ##fi anna ##n , appealed for calm after the poll and urged zimbabwe ##ans to refrain from violence .
facing perhaps a legal challenge from the opposition to his contested electoral victory , mug ##abe is becoming increasingly isolated on the international stage .
but the zimbabwe ##an leader has been silent since his final campaign rally last friday , though people are eagerly awaiting his victory speech .
the president was nowhere to be seen in hara ##re as his supporters took over the downtown streets of the capital , loudly celebrating his victory .
mug ##abe ' s allies and det ##rac ##tors may all hope that he is spending the time reviewing the tense situation in the country and working out how best to calm fears and concern and rally zimbabwe ##ans together .
this has prompted two of washington ' s closest allies , britain and australia , to express their " concern " over the way the prisoners were transported from afghanistan and the way they are being treated in captivity .
it is obvious that statements by us defense secretary donald rum ##sf ##eld that the detainees are " illegitimate fighters " upon home the geneva convention on pow ' s does not apply have not helped alleviate world concern over the us abandoning its ( until now ) well - known commitment to the principles of justice in treating the al - q ##a ' ida and taliban prisoners .
as the campaign of western criticism of the united states height ##ens , it has become urgent for washington to clarify its stand on treating the prisoners and their destiny so that it would not be recorded in history that the number one democracy in the war won the war on terrorism in weeks and lost the reputation of commitment to principles of human justice that it took centuries to gain .
the venezuelan president was officially welcomed at me ##hra ##bad international airport by minister of mines and metals , es ##ha ##q ja ##hang ##iri .
president k ##hat ##ami , in a telephone conversation with president chavez last week , called on member states of the organization of petroleum export ##ing countries ( op ##ec ) to join hands to prevent a steep fall in oil prices .
" we appreciate the return to stability of venezuela ' s domestic situation , " foreign ministry spoke ##sw ##oman zhang qi ##yu ##e said .
" we believe that under the leadership of president chavez , the people of venezuela will devote themselves to political stability and economic development and make more progress in social advancement . "
as a friend of venezuela , china hoped to further strengthen friendship and cooperation with the country , zhang said .
in their december , 1995 review of the nation ' s best charities , u . s . news & world report called goodwill one of the five " stand ##out good guys . "

hara ##re , zimbabwe - as robert mug ##abe moved to consolidate his victory in elections most observers denounced as rigged , an ugly split was opening up in the response from black african nations and the west .
the win gives the 78 - year - old mr . mug ##abe a six - year term in office and was hailed by patrick china ##mas ##a , zimbabwe ' s justice minister , as a " runaway victory . "
the des ##pon ##dent former union boss appeared be ##fu ##ddled by the result , as if he had never expected mr . mug ##abe to pull out a victory using just about every shady tactic in the book .
george bush , the u . s . president , led the criticism from the west , saying washington would not recognize mr . mug ##abe ' s government .
" we do not recognize the outcome of the election because we think it ' s flawed , " mr . bush said .
jack straw , britain ' s foreign secretary , condemned mr . mug ##abe for wa ##ging a " systematic campaign of violence . "
opposition critics attacked the prime minister for not immediately den ##oun ##cing the election .

" we seek no confrontation with the state , " said the md ##c leader , who is already facing treason charges for allegedly plotting to assassinate mr . mug ##abe , a charge he says was trump ##ed up .
domestic observers tended to side with the md ##c , den ##oun ##cing the election as fraud - tainted and unfair .

washington has expressed concern to the lebanese authorities about the possibility of a hi ##z ##bu ##llah attack against israel within the next couple of days , and requested that efforts be deployed to prevent such a development , official sources disclosed friday .
lebanese officials have avoided publicly commenting on the new message from washington .
" it is israel that is responsible for all kinds of provocative activities , " one official source remarked , referring in particular to air raids and other aggressive acts against lebanon .
lebanese authorities expect the united states to curb such israeli in ##fra ##ctions , the official source added , rather than adopt israeli claims and seek security for the jewish state .
according to a government official in contact with us politicians recently , hostility toward hi ##z ##bu ##llah has grown tremendous ##ly in recent months within the us administration .

the chinese president said his country objects to the israeli policies represented in military attacks , economic siege on palestinians and expansion of the jewish settlements as well as to the acts of violence against innocent civilians .
the chinese leader said president mu ##bara ##k telephone ##d him after last september 11th incidents urging him to do his best for saving the peace process between palestinians and israel .
he said his country has repeatedly , through proper diplomatic channels , urged the israeli side to fulfill its pledge ##s and to respond favorably to endeavors aimed at reaching a settlement in the middle east through negotiations .
he indicated that china would continue to play its role in supporting the peaceful settlement in the middle east adding that he would discuss with president bush , who will visit beijing next month , ways of react ##ivating the peace process between palestinians and israelis .

china had always " firmly opposed " the us taiwan affairs act , which mandates by law the us defense of taiwan and forms the basis for us arms sales to the island , he said .
sino - us ties have greatly improved since beijing backed the us fight against global terrorism and its bombing campaign of terrorist targets in afghanistan following the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states .
tang conceded there had been " twists and turns " following us president george w . bush ' s accession to the us presidency in early last year , but said the relationship had improved with bush ' s visits to china in october and last month .

environmental ##ist groups staged a protest against the u . s . alternative to the kyoto protocol on curb ##ing global warming near the u . s . embassy in tokyo on sunday prior to president george w . bush ' s arrival in the capital .
about 50 members of various japanese and u . s . non ##go ##vern ##mental organizations ( ngos ) opposed to the u . s . alternative to the 1997 pact gathered around 1 p . m . at tame ##ike - san ##no station , close to the embassy in tokyo ' s mina ##to ward .
protesters carried banners reading , " rat ##ify the kyoto protocol , " and " ko ##iz ##umi say ' no ' to bush : stick to kyoto protocol . "
in the letter , the ngos said , " we , japanese environmental ngos concerned about climate change , were terribly dismay ##ed by your new climate change plan . "
on thursday , bush unveiled the new plan that calls for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions by companies in accordance with economic growth instead of mandatory reduction targets .
bush sparked international out ##cr ##y when he rejected the kyoto protocol last march , saying it would mean sac ##ri ##fi ##cing u . s . economic growth .
" we demand of you , mr . president , to rec ##ons ##ider your climate policy plan immediately and re - enter the kyoto protocol .

there will be no access to detainees ( the geneva convention forbid ##s making them a " public curiosity " ) .
" this is bullshit , " thunder ##s another print reporter .
in the richest irony of the war on terrorism , the department of defense , which normally goes out of its way not to make news , caused an international out ##cr ##y by releasing still shots of detainees being brought to camp x - ray .
though these seemed perfectly reasonable precautions to take when transporting by c - 141 members of an organization already responsible for one prison uprising ( ma ##zar - i - sharif , which resulted in a cia operative ' s death ) and several suicide plane crashes , human rights groups and international media , led by a chorus of euro - w ##hine ##rs , immediately laps ##ed into h ##yst ##eric ##s .

there was no money to buy any presents at all , um , for the children , and my grandfather , who was killed when my mother was 16 , this was , of course , way before that , um , he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he , he told the children that there were no presents this christmas because they had given them all to santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves .

private organizations are also being encouraged to help fight sands ##torm ##s , according to the administration ' s vice - director li yu ##ca ##i .
he has been patron ##izing his subordinate ##s during his entire presidency and was finally rewarded for his support : the para ##tro ##opers helped him regain power .
protesters , who ousted hugo chavez at the end of the previous week , failed to gain the support of the army .
the majority of the population , who was not delighted with chavez , was not on their side as well .
ordinary venezuelan ##s are even less happy with the generals and local ol ##iga ##rch ##ic elite .
indeed , it was clear since the very beginning that pedro car ##mona , who proclaimed himself interim president would care very little for improving ordinary people ' s lives .
vice - president di ##os ##dad ##o cab ##ello , a hugo chavez supporter , is acting president as of now .
chavez supporters say that no witch - hunting will follow and the opposition should not be afraid of persecution .
as for ordinary venezuelan ##s , they seem to be slightly anxious about the struggle for the presidential post .

rum ##sf ##eld defend ##s u . s . treatment of detainees in cuba
it was prompted by a rising tide of international criticism after the defense department released photographs over the weekend that showed some of the prisoners kneeling before their capt ##ors , their legs in shack ##les , their hands bound in mana ##cles , their mouths covered by surgical masks and their eyes blinded by large go ##ggles with black tape .
the international committee of the red cross , in a rare break with its code of not publicly criticizing det ##ain ##ing governments , said the united states might have violated geneva convention rules against making a spectacle of prisoners by distributing the pictures , which were published worldwide .
amnesty international sought access to the prisoners in guantanamo and said they should be allowed to have lawyers .
the netherlands also urged washington to recognize the detainees as prisoners of war , saying , " in the fight , we need to uphold our norms and values . "
while debate raged elsewhere , britain and spain supported the united states .
spanish foreign minister jose ##p pi ##que said the spanish government " does not have the slightest doubt regarding the position of the u . s . government . "
" if you want to think the worst about things , you can , " he said .
" to give standing under a geneva convention to a terrorist organization that ' s not a country is something that i think some of the lawyers who did not drop out of law school as i did worry about as a precedent , " he said .
in los angeles , a federal district judge questioned today whether he had the authority to consider a challenge to the detention of the prisoners in cuba .
he spoke at a hearing on a petition filed on sunday by a group of lawyers , cleric ##s and professors who demand that the detainees be identified , taken before a court and told of the charges against them .
officials br ##istle at us human rights report
local authorities have expressed dissatisfaction - but not surprise - with regard to excerpts about lebanon in the us state department ' s annual report on human rights , a copy of which has been delivered to the foreign ministry .
an official source who described the reaction on tuesday said the criticism was an annual event and emphasized that it was not directed at human rights in lebanon only , but covered several other countries in as well .
a copy of the report , which critic ##izes what it described as the weakening of the central government ' s pre ##ro ##gative ##s , has been handed over by the deputy chief of mission at the us embassy in aw ##kar , carol kali ##n , to the foreign ministry ' s acting director - general , na ##ji ab ##i ass ##i .
according to the source , the authorities ' dissatisfaction with the contents of the report has been conveyed to us ambassador vincent battle , who returned from washington on saturday after participating in a conference of american envoy ##s posted to arab countries .
on the other hand , the report praised the role played by the lebanese press , describing it as containing daily criticism of the government and its practices .
according to dr al - am ##ri , the top priority of saudi businesses these days is the application of customer relationship management ( cr ##m ) capabilities .

in brussels on wednesday [ 28 november ] , the french astronaut cl ##aud ##ie hai ##gne ##re , who had just completed a flight in space together with the russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for de win ##ne , could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen , with whom she trained for several months in moscow .
people there are really unanimous about him , " she told us .
" this assessment confirms us in our choices , " a delighted y ##lie ##ff said .
as pic ##que emphasized , " for many years , each fran ##c invested by belgium in space has brought in three francs . "
the i ##hr ##c said in a statement to mark december 10 , " international day for human rights " that the international community has formulated numerous documents to honor human rights after 50 years of bitter experience and the heavy losses that the humanity has suffered .
the statement said that several hundred documents have been signed to promote human rights and different cultures have put forward their outlook ##s about human rights and en ##vis ##aged measures to stop violation of human rights .
the i ##hr ##c called for prohibition of discrimination , torture , arbitrary detention and honoring the human rights , political rights , the rights of associations , the women ' s rights as well as the rights en ##vis ##aged in the international declaration for human rights as recommended by the divine religions several centuries ago .
the statement regretted that provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized .
the statement de ##pl ##ored the injustice against the palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists , journalists , the religious minorities , the children and women in some parts of the world .
the i ##hr ##c said that all nations and religions condemned the september 11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the statement urged the states ##men in different countries to hee ##d the religious teachings calling for respect for human rights and said that no peace will be established without honoring human
meanwhile , in another development , the geneva - based united nations high commissioner for human rights mary robinson called on israel to stop bombing the palestinian targets in the west bank and gaza strip and allow in international monitors .
she denounced israeli terrorist attacks against palestinian activists , urging it to halt what she called targeted killing of palestinians .
hara ##re : western countries were left frustrated and imp ##ote ##nt after robert mug ##abe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly won zimbabwe ' s presidential election .
the move is almost certain to sc ##uppe ##r any hope of the commonwealth suspend ##ing zimbabwe next week .
" we seek no confrontation with the state because that ' s what they want .
in the hara ##re townships where people stood in line for two days to vote in the belief that they were con ##si ##gni ##ng mug ##abe to history , angry residents looked to ts ##van ##gi ##rai to confront the government .
apart from the result , the main jolt yesterday was that election observers from south africa , nigeria and namibia effectively endorsed the election .
" it is our considered view that the election was free and fair and reflects the wishes of the people of zimbabwe , " namibia ' s observer team said in a statement , adding that the poll was " water ##tight , without room for rig ##ging " .
in zimbabwe the leadership of the congress of trade unions is considering calling a two - day general strike to test whether there would be popular support for a longer protest , and various civil rights groups are meeting today to discuss mass civil di ##so ##bed ##ience .
chatter ##box feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the sub ##text ( and hence much of the appeal ) of a hillary clinton - rudy gi ##ulia ##ni senate race would be wrong ##ed wife vs .
many have already opined that the mayor is too vi ##tu ##per ##ative , too much of a lone ##r to practice the cong ##enia ##l , team ##work - oriented politics of the senate ; other doubt ##ers have pointed to his hard ##hearted , un ##car ##ing social policies .
but she did say in the interview , which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about hillary rod ##ham clinton ' s interest in the same new york senate seat , that mrs . clinton is a ' very interesting ' person .
' i think she ' s dynamic , and i think she ' s very smart , and she ' s an amazing speaker , ' ms . hanover said . "

" we just want someone who can give us food , hospitals , school fees .
there are many martha ##s here , people who marched to za ##nu - p ##f anthem ##s and cheered president robert mug ##abe at rallies , while secretly planning to vote for mr . ts ##van ##gi ##rai .
" people pretend to be za ##nu - p ##f because they are afraid .
" i wanted to go home , but i have to vote , " she says .
the government slashed the number of polling stations in urban areas where the md ##c is favored , while boost ##ing the number in rural ruling - party stronghold ##s .
now the country ' s 5 . 6 million voters are waiting anxiously for the results of the poll to be announced , although the voting , which was supposed to end sunday , may stretch on for days .
an increasing number of local election monitors and international observers say the vote rig ##ging has been so thorough that hopes for a free election are dead .
mr . murphy points to the lack of independent voter education , the lack of any independent radio stations , and the ban on holding opposition rallies in many districts as just a few examples .
there is a deep faith here , however , in the power of democracy .
but he wanted to sound his voice .
mug ##abe is trying to move the goal posts to di ##sen ##fra ##nch ##ise people , these people he thinks will vote against him , " said ts ##van ##gi ##rai , visiting one polling station where thousands waited angrily to cast their votes , waving their hands in the open - handed signal of the md ##c .
the md ##c says that 52 percent of its rural polling agents were chased away , abducted , or refused accreditation by government officials , leaving the voting process open to widespread abuse .
a moment later she had decided , and the polling agent , smiling , put an " x " mark on the ballot in the space marked " robert mug ##abe , za ##nu - p ##f . "
despite everything , there is still hope in zimbabwe that this election may bring change .
" i am happy because i finally got to vote , " says a ju ##bil ##ant colin chip ##ep ##era , after waiting for more than 12 hours in one hara ##re voting line .
" i think this is the final nail on the government ' s coffin .

although the white house and the pentagon have denied supporting the opposition ##s in venezuela to stage this coup , the world will not be easily fooled as it can judge from the several official statements made by the us government both before and after the coup .
at the time when the ab ##ort ##ive coup had just taken place , the united states " did not show the slightest sympathy , " still less " the least regret , " for the breaking - off of venezuela ' s democratic system .
both the white house and the us state department expressed " satisfaction " over the stepping - down of hugo chavez , venezuela ' s constitutional president , and no one " wept over him . "
besides , they also claimed that chavez " had only himself to blame " for the coup .
this special meeting was initiated by the united states , with only one single goal to fulfill , that is , ins ##ti ##gating op ##c ##w member states to vote out bust ##ani .
it has been reported that the united states had earlier held a secret meeting with a number of countries , promising to pay for their long due op ##c ##w membership fees if they could vote according to the wish of the united states .
why has the united states been picking on chavez and bust ##ani all this time ?
after chavez took office as venezuelan president , he has pursued an independent foreign policy , and has been out of step with the united states in many areas .
during his visits to some op ##ec member states in 2000 , he also paid a visit to baghdad ; meanwhile , he has all along maintained a close relationship with cuba .
as for bust ##ani , he hoped that baghdad could become a member of the op ##c ##w so that the united nations could conduct arms inspections in the country .
to the united states , what bust ##ani wanted to do was even more into ##ler ##able , as it would disrupt the us plan of launching a military strike against iraq .
according to new york times , the united states is inclined to put friendly faces in the presidential palace of latin american nations , no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms .
when questioned by a reporter " why the united states has supported a certain cold - blooded dictator in latin america , " roosevelt gave a vivid reply :
in simpler terms , the interests of the united states are always above everything else , not only above the sovereignty of other nations , but also above the so - called values of " democracy " and " human rights " that the us always likes to dwell on .
the annual human rights report of the us state department has been strongly criticized and condemned by many countries .
many countries in asia , europe , africa , and latin america have rejected the content of the us human rights report , calling it a bra ##zen distortion of the situation , a wrong ##ful and illegitimate move , and an interference in the internal affairs of other countries .
recently , the information office of the chinese people ' s congress released a report on human rights in the united states in 2001 , criticizing violations of human rights there .
the british news agency reuters remarked that in the 2000 human rights report , the united states criticized egypt for trying suspected terrorists in military courts .
in light of the united states ' malicious goals , its annual human rights report for 2001 is facing strong protest and criticism from the world .
mr . chavez was ousted in a military coup on april 12 after 17 persons were killed during an anti - chavez protest , apparently by sharp ##sho ##ote ##rs faithful to the president .
following the coup , 40 persons , mostly chavez supporters , were killed while protesting .
according to taped radio conversations broadcast yesterday in venezuela on radio and television , mr . chavez ordered tanks and troops to surround the presidential palace , as unarmed civilian protesters marched against him on april 11 .
" we are happy to collectively have overcome the era of coup d ' etat ##s in the region , and when events in venezuela took on the appearance of a military coup there was a reaction by everyone , " said brazil ' s president fernando henri ##que card ##oso .
the venezuelan leader has struck friendships with cuban , libyan and iraqi leaders with great fan ##fare , and his open defiance of u . s . interests has woo ##ed venezuelan ##s wary of u . s . power .
he has also alien ##ated workers at his country ' s state - owned oil company , petrol ##eo ##s de venezuela , by replacing long - serving professionals with his supporters .
interesting ##ly , mr . chavez initially rose to power in the 1990s because of the discontent with former president carlos andres perez , who had ordered the military to shoot at crowds in 1989 .

zambia hail ##s result
" i am pleased to learn of the re - election of president robert mug ##abe as president of zimbabwe , " mw ##ana ##was ##a said in a statement .
three of the 10 losing presidential candidates in zambia ' s december 27 vote have petitioned the supreme court to null ##ify the results , charging that mw ##ana ##was ##a won the election by fraud .
vietnamese minister of science , technology and environment chu tu ##an nh ##a told the first asia - europe meeting [ as ##em ] environment ministers ' meeting [ as ##em en ##mm ] in beijing recently that vietnam always values environmental protection , including prevention of pollution or degradation , bio - diversity protection , and improvement of the environment in industrial zones and in both urban and rural areas .
the vietnamese minister called for the establishment of a cooperation forum on the environment which will be held every two years within the asia - europe environment cooperation program .
africa ' s two richest and most powerful nations , south africa and nigeria , decided to punish zimbabwe on tuesday for a flawed presidential vote .
this grand bargain to up ##lift the world ' s poor ##est continent would have been in jeopardy if tha ##bo mbe ##ki , south africa ' s president , and ol ##use ##gun ob ##asa ##n ##jo , nigeria ' s president , had not agreed to suspend zimbabwe from the 54 - nation group of former british colonies known as the commonwealth .
their endorsement of yet another type of diplomatic isolation of zimbabwe shows solidarity with the west .
mr . mbe ##ki may still hope that , despite his joining the west in criticizing zimbabwe ##an leader robert mug ##abe , he can work with his troubled neighbor to prevent more violence , keep the economy from collapsing , and find some political compromise .
mbe ##ki and other african leaders need to press mr . mug ##abe to stop his repression and to not take farmland from whites without just compensation .
many of the continent ' s other governments found little fault with the way mug ##abe ran the election , despite overwhelming evidence of voter intimidation and manipulation of polls .
a strike this week by the country ' s trade unions protesting the government ' s tactics reflects widespread disgust with mug ##abe .
but now that he ' s cornered by the international community with many types of isolation - including op ##pro ##bri ##um from two of his african peers - he has lashed out by charging opposition leader morgan ts ##van ##gi ##rai with trying to kill him .
south africa ' s leader , mbe ##ki , who has been inclined toward " quiet diplomacy " with zimbabwe , has now made himself heard .
it may or may not be to the liking of the western foreign ministries which shared to some extent washington ' s pleasure at the ou ##sti ##ng of hugo chavez , but the course of events in venezuela has shown that he has the support of the majority of the population , who want him in the presidency , from which he was deposed and in which he was reins ##tal ##led by the military in a confused uprising . . .
criticisms of chavez ' s governance have been widespread in the democratic world , above all in the past year , in which he has taken to visiting dictator ##s like castro or saddam hu ##say ##n and writing to terrorists like the famous carlos , instead of meeting his promises of prosperity and fair shares .
this possibility and the proliferation of expressions of support for the overthrow ##n leader among the military officers made a change of course ad ##vis ##able , with the forced resignation of car ##mona and the even more meteor ##ic period in office of chavez ' s vice - president , di ##os ##dad ##o cab ##ello , who only took up the post in order to give his leader time to re ##app ##ear .
all of this leaves in the air a feeling of military uncertainty , after a two - way trip in 24 hours which will undoubtedly leave deep wounds in armed forces which clearly have not given up their wish to ex ##ert a decisive influence in political life .
the test , which was carried out in conform ##ity with the rules for such cases , raised suspicions of bs ##e , which were later confirmed .
the persons wanted to escape abroad .
" this signing sends a message to sad ##c of the importance with which the new us administration views regional integration in southern africa , " us ambassador to botswana john lange , who is also the special representative of the us government to sad ##c , said .
rams ##amy also condemned last tuesday ' s terror attacks in the united states .
" the sad ##c secretariat condemn ##s un ##res ##erved ##ly and in the strongest terms this act of terrorism , " he said .
we are grateful for the strong support expressed by the international community , particularly the sad ##c member states . "
" we learnt of the attacks with great shock and sorrow , " the ministers said .
" we strongly condemn this g ##has ##tly and bar ##bari ##c act of terrorism and want ##on destruction of property and the loss of innocent lives .
the people of the us are known for their strong sense of justice which will no doubt see them through this trying time and bring the cu ##lp ##rit ##s to book . "
ind ##idi ##s appealed to the public to assist the police with information that might lead to the re - arrest of the prisoners .
his second was to announce the end of the three - day general strike he had called with the head of the confederation of venezuelan workers ( ctv ) leader carlos ortega in support of protesting managers from state oil company pd ##vs ##a .
managers were striking because mr chavez had filled the company ' s board of directors with his supporters .
as marche ##rs called for mr chavez ' s resignation outside mira ##fl ##ores , the presidential palace , shots were fired into the crowd .
at the time , mr chavez was addressing the nation to assure them his government respected people ' s right to demonstrate and freedom of the press .
moments later he announced that he had taken five national television channels off the air for " telling lies about the government " .
a succession of officers filled the tv screens to say they supported the people and that the killings were " not to ##ler ##able " .
in the early hours of the morning , chief of the armed forces general lucas ri ##nco ##n held a brief news conference to say mr chavez ' s resignation had been demanded and accepted .
news of mr chavez ' s resignation caused hundreds of flag - waving and whistle - blowing venezuelan ##s to surround the city ' s air force base , la carlo ##ta , in the hope of seeing mr chavez ' departure from the country .
" i think people are happy because chavez has fallen .
but there ' s also a feeling of uncertainty about how the country ' s obvious problems are going to be solved , " said ms led ##es ##ma .

if you want a holiday in space and have the means to pay for it , russia offers you the trip of a lifetime .
" there is a free place for the flight in october and we are looking for someone who would like to take it " , he declared .
he has called for helping aggressive israel to put a traitor ##ous agent at the head of the palestinian authority , who could accept its terms to " assassinate ' the rights of palestinians .
it is certain the ben eli ##ezer ' s hall ##uc ##ination is a mere expression of failure to persuade the world to accept the brutality of the occupying forces ' practices .
ben eli ##ezer ' s ravi ##ng coincided with the arrival of his assassin boss sharon to washington to take part in ex ##ert ##ing pressures on the us administration , and persuade it that removing ara ##fat could bring about the palestinian surrender , and halt violence as he calls it .
they , along with the ex ##tre ##mist gang in the israeli government , do not want to understand that ara ##fat symbol ##izes the palestinian struggle .
with this attitude , sharon ' s government showed its true hostility for a leader and chairman elected by his people .
i do wish that burns ' s statements reflect a true position that signals a return of balance to the us position in dealing with the reality of palestinian - israeli struggle .
this fore ##tell ##s that the israeli occupation ' s claims will inevitably falls , no matter how long sharon hum ##ilia ##tes arab dignity , relay ##ing on the protection and support of washington , which forgot all principles and role in defending justice , and international legitimacy .
islamabad , march 5 : the government on tuesday rejected the us state department report on human rights as " factual ##ly inaccurate and un ##war ##rant ##ed " adding that it reflected tendency of some states to sit in judgment on others .
recently the system of joint electorate ##s has been introduced respecting the wishes of the minority communities , it said .
the government of pakistan therefore , feels constrained to reject the assessment of the report about pakistan , and the tendency of some states to sit in judgment over others . "
chavez ' s policies were aimed at eliminating injustice and poverty in his country .
as a result , industrialist ##s and prominent capitalist ##s , as well as defeated political forces acting as foreign agents and the military figures associated with them , became concerned about the situation .
as far as the issue of foreign policy was concerned , chavez sought to preserve the independence of his country in the face of american pressure .
in this way , he sought to implement his policy of eliminating poverty .
in latin and south america , hugo chavez established close and friendly relations with cuban president fide ##l castro and invited him to visit his country .
he also supported movements that opposed american intervention in the region , thereby in ##fur ##iating washington .
that was particularly because his policies enjoyed widespread support among regional countries .
washington was concerned that the chavez model might affect other [ latin ] american countries .
moreover , america also openly opposed chavez ' s policies of establishing friendly relations with certain countries that pursued independent regional and international policies .
nevertheless , the most important reason for america ' s concern was the issue of oil .
following iran ' s proposal on cutting off the supply of oil to countries that support israel for one month , which was supported by some oil - export ##ing countries , there was an increasing probability that venezuela would also support [ the proposal ] .
it also served the interests of the forces that opposed chavez inside [ venezuela ] .
true , prisoners are now confined to 6 - ft . by 8 - ft . chain - link enclosure ##s with concrete floors and tin roofs ( rum ##sf ##eld thinks it ' s " pe ##jo ##rative " to call them cages ) .
but relief will come ; in three months , the pentagon hopes to replace the facility with something more permanent .
but in the european press , the prisoners ' lot has become a public issue of contention among those who demand that u . s . conduct be above suspicion .
the daily telegraph , a paper usually so conservative that it makes pat buchanan look vegetarian , warned washington of the need to draw a " distinction between civilized society and the apocalyptic savage ##ry of those who would destroy it . "
the pentagon has resisted calling the detainees prisoners of war , preferring the terms unlawful combatants or battlefield detainees .
under the geneva convention , those holding true pow ##s are bound to release them at the end of hostilities ; but that is the last thing the u . s . wants to do with men who may be al - qaeda operatives .
until the pentagon sorts out the legal issues , criticism from europe is likely to grow .
moreover , the pressures from advanced countries to get south korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen .
the u . s . backed out of the agreement , saying its industries would be handicapped by string ##ent rules that developing countries could simply ignore .
" the government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstract ##ly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption , " an industry source said .
at the request of the red crescent society of pakistan , ace ##c has called for donations of relief goods on its web site since early november .
ace ##c is also calling for monetary donations because it needs more money to pay shipping costs , the officials said .
the abduction , however , delivered a more devastating blow on the capacity of the mac ##apa ##gal administration to crack down on kidnap syndicate ##s than the grim statistics tr ##otted out by ter ##es ##ita ang - see , the chinese - filipino anti - crime " crusader , " who has re ##lish ##ed the role of cassandra to the philippine national police under the new administration .
but the seizure of the diplomat ' s wife and her driver was the first time in 10 years that the gangs struck at members of the diplomatic community , whose immunity has been somehow respected by organized syndicate ##s .
the seizure sent alarm bells ringing in the diplomatic community in this country .
then president joseph estrada had to cancel visits to paris and other european capitals in 2000 after he was told that he would receive a hostile reception from the european public over the lengthy imp ##asse of negotiations for the hostages ' release .
whether the incident was plain hold ##up , as the p ##np would like to see it , the abduction reinforced the growing perception in the diplomatic community and foreign governments that there is a breakdown in law and order and that the mac ##apa ##gal administration is not in control .
some administration officials wonder whether she paints doom ##sd ##ay scenarios just to em ##bar ##ras ##s the administration and to portray the contrast in performance between the p ##np under lac ##son and the current p ##np leadership , which has no love lost with lac ##son .
since the members of the diplomatic community had previously been immune from the predatory attacks of the gang , the abduction of the diplomat ' s wife naturally has generated an ##xie ##ties among foreign governments about how safe their diplomats are in this country .
there is a strong perception in the diplomatic community that the abduction was a fake kidnap - for - ransom and was a political act to demonstrate the administration ' s inca ##pac ##ity to put crime under control .
the perception is that there was a political message in the abduction ##s staged by some groups that are determined to make this government fail .
the diplomatic community ' s perception of president mac ##apa ##gal is that she is organized , knows her economics , does her homework , and has been un ##sca ##thed by scandals that have been rubbed on her skin by a scandal - mon ##ger ##ing opposition .
but the downs ##ide is that the deterioration of peace and order is her nemesis that is undo ##ing all her diplomatic initiatives in the world stage to project the philippines as a staunch ally in the us - led coalition in the war on international terrorism .
some diplomats raise questions about her priorities .
we are concerned about the events , " white house spokesman ari fl ##eis ##cher told reporters at a regular news briefing .

if you can increase your last donation , we would appreciate that show of support for the camp ##ers and their efforts to overcome obstacles and create successful lives .
the white house is said to be embarrassed by the report .
but they had been told that chavez , whose friendship with libya , iraq and cuba has angered washington , should only be replaced by legitimate , constitutional means ; the us would not support a coup .
americans will want to know who exactly is running their country .
for the rest of the world , however , the story already confirms the suspicions that the bush administration is hell - bent on eliminating its enemies by whatever means possible , legal or illegal .
the government wants to play an active role internationally but we should also work on reducing emissions here at home .
" the government wants to point to a significant reduction of climate gate emissions before 2005 after norway has ratified the kyoto protocol in the course of the year , " environmental protection minister borg ##e br ##end ##e has written .
in the se ##m statement the coalition government warned of a more offensive climate policy .
initiatives between now and 2008 : the government wants to show demons ##tra ##ble progress in the reduction of climate emissions by 2005 .
the government wants to set the stage for norway to rat ##ify the kyoto protocol next year .
norway still wants to play an active role in this process .
a proposal for an early quota system will be at the center of this report .
businesses that are ob ##liga ##ted by a quota can then choose whether they want to buy those quota ##s they need or introduce measures to reduce emissions .
i am pleased that there now seems to be broad political consensus that in norway as well we should get under way with an early quota system .
their complaint : the system discourage ##s working because unemployment provides benefits that many entry - level jobs do n ' t include .
apart from criticizing the " axis of evil " countries for abu ##sing human rights , it also listed abuses in several countries that are members of the anti - terrorist alliance .
con ##sol ##ida ##ting the anti - terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overs ##had ##owing concerns about human rights .
in exchange for support for its war on terror , the us is ta ##cit ##ly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the anti - terror coalition .
the report express ##ly points out that , " it is extremely easy for terrorists to find supporters in countries where human rights are not respected and where individual freedom is rep ##ressed . "
to prove that human rights are important ammunition in the battle against terror , then , the us must attack terrorism to make human rights matter to these countries .
if , however , us president george w . bush still believes in the supremacy of human rights , he must not forget the breeding ground for terrorists that exists within the anti - terrorist alliance .
therefore , the two administrations , from the position of a " victor , " have called for an international or regional peace conference .
in addition , they seek to convince other parties of these two ideas and are waiting for the concerned parties to agree to them , or , at least , to the first one , after which these two administrations will set their own conditions at the table .
it is thus an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumph ##ed and that they are now in a position to di ##cta ##te their own conditions on this great people .
most importantly , however , these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquid ##ating the int ##if ##ada ##h and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquid ##ating or arresting a small or large number of the int ##if ##ada ##h ' s leaders and struggle ##rs .
he added : " if more fighters and martyr ##dom - seeking ones fall , other fighters and martyr ##dom - seeking ones will emerge , who are ready to follow in their footsteps . "
the conclusion to which we come is that the zionist and us administrations have aggravated the zionist entity ' s historical imp ##asse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that " force " can break the palestinian people ' s will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose .
millions of arabs , palestinians and non - palestinians alike , now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve " coe ##xi ##sten ##ce " with this us ##ur ##ping , occupying , aggressive , and racist entity .
israeli arab leaders yesterday pledged to fight a proposed 25 % - 30 % cut in national insurance institute child benefits for those who have not served in the army or completed national service .
the forum of arab council heads is to meet tomorrow to draw up an action campaign aimed at th ##wart ##ing the plan , part of a package of recommendations put forward by the treasury for a ni ##s 13 million cut in government spending .
shaw ##qi k ##hat ##ib , chairman of the monitoring committee of the israeli arab leadership , said arabs would be hardest hit if the government approve ##s the cut ##backs in child benefits .
k ##hat ##ib , who also chairs the forum of arab council heads , said the leadership is dia ##metric ##ally opposed to any cut ##backs , particularly when those affecting the lower socio - economic strata of society .
" i remember when the late prime minister yi ##tz ##ha ##q ra ##bin did away with the discrimination that had existed for years and equal ##ized child benefits regardless of whether parents had served in the army or not , " za ##yd ##an said .
" we app ##lau ##ded this move because it was not only just , but it made us begin to feel that we , as arabs , were an integral part of israeli society .
if this move goes through , we will once again feel that we are being disc ##rim ##inated against . "
ottawa - the plight of prisoners and politicians has been weighing heavily on the minds of editorial writers and pun ##dit ##s in and around the nation ' s capital .
the citizen argues that canada should " insist " the united states " allow a ' competent tribunal ' to decide the legal status of the detainees , as required by the geneva convention .
in an editorial appearing this week , the newspaper is une ##qui ##vo ##cal in its u . s . support .
" if os ##ama bin laden is still alive , we suspect he is giving the civil rights advocates a heart ##y thumbs up . "
no one , however , is giving a heart ##y thumbs up to mr . tobin .
rather , his sudden departure from politics provoked much criticism .
" mr . tobin seems content to be back home on the rock playing with his bag of marble ##s and collecting his parliamentary pension . "
in the citizen , columnist rosa harris - adler wrote a devastating ##ly sarcastic piece , rid ##ic ##ulin ##g mr . tobin ' s assertion that he was leaving for family reasons .
pakistan rejects us human rights report
recently , the system of joint electorate ##s has been introduced respecting the wishes of the minority communities , " the spokesman said .
" the government of pakistan , therefore , feels constrained to reject the assessment of the report about pakistan , and the tendency of some states to sit in judgement over others .
he said that the government of pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and will welcome the assistance of friendly countries towards that end .
the tragic and shocking events that shook the united states , destroying a number of its economic , urban , and military landmarks , have aroused grief and sorrow worldwide .
the scenes of destruction reminded the palestinian people of the ongoing devastation and the palestinians who are falling victim to the israeli acts of bombardment , targeted assassination ##s , and inc ##urs ##ions into palestinian towns and villages , including bay ##t ja ##la , gaza , khan yun ##us , raf ##ah , jan ##in , tu ##lka ##rm , ram ##lal ##lah , jericho , na ##bu ##lus , and others .
nobody who has a live conscience and human feelings , whether he is palestinian or otherwise , could not have been moved by these events and expressed sympathy for the families of the us victims , regardless of the us political stance ##s that are totally biased to israel and israel ' s use of the most advanced us weapons to curb the palestinian int ##if ##ada ##h .
this is because the palestinians were , and still are , hoping that the americans would realize , if they have not already realized , the justice of the palestinian cause and the enormous injustice suffered by the palestinians , who were expelled from their homeland , whose land was occupied , and who were deprived of the minimum political and human rights .
if any people are going to be moved by the scenes of destruction that involved manhattan , the world trade center , and the pentagon , it is the palestinian people .
while the world is busy following the news of the attacks on the us targets and feeling sorry for these acts , israel carried out an inc ##urs ##ion into jan ##in and the neighboring villages , bomb ##arded more palestinian internal security sites , demolished more homes in east jerusalem , and killed an additional number of palestinian activists and non - activists , including an 11 - year - old girl .
the palestinians want nothing from washington but to understand their cause and stand beside right and justice .
sub ##head : law ##makers boycott event
hara ##re , zimbabwe - president robert mug ##abe was sworn in sunday for his fifth term in office following a bitterly fought election that the opposition and many western governments denounced as rigged .
he told an audience assembled in the colonial - style state house mansion that his victory was a triumph against the west and whites who he said had aligned against him and his governing party , the zimbabwe african national union - patriotic front .
but the 57 law ##makers from the opposition movement for democratic change boycott ##ed it , as did representatives from the united states , european union countries , new zealand and canada .
mug ##abe appealed to the nation and the opposition to reconcile to address the pressing economic needs , but fell short of proposing a government of national unity .
south african president tha ##bo mbe ##ki and nigerian president ol ##use ##gun ob ##asa ##n ##jo are pressing mug ##abe to accept such an arrangement to avoid deep ##ening international sanctions and suspension from the commonwealth of britain and its former colonies .
as the leader of the region ' s most robust economy and most respected democracy , many western leaders are looking to mbe ##ki to den ##oun ##ce the results and provide some re ##ass ##urance that the continent is committed to democratic principles and property rights .
investors and western diplomats have said they might interpret mbe ##ki ' s support for mug ##abe or the elections as a sign that africa is not intent on rev ##ital ##izing its economies through good government and expanded international trade .
rama ##llah ( palestine media center ) : signaling a tough ##ening policy towards the illegal israeli settlements , the european union ' s ( eu ) origin committee , which consists of customs experts and commissioners , is to discuss imposing taxes on all israeli goods produced in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem as well as the occupied go ##lan heights .
it also signals the eu ' s discontent over israel ' s refusal to provide it with a list of the israeli factories operating in the occupied palestinian and arab territories .
in november of last year , the eu had issued a warning to european import ##ers , specify ##ing that israeli exports originating in the occupied palestinian territory as well as the go ##lan heights were not included in the free trade agreement with israel .
and while the israeli settlement products only amount to us $ 100 million of the us $ 8 billion israel gains annually from its exports to europe , israeli officials have expressed their worry over the committee ' s del ##ibe ##rations .
president per ##vez mu ##sha ##rra ##f will pay a state visit to china from 20th to 24th of this month at the invitation of the president of china , mr . jiang ze ##min .
in perfect agreement with the latest polls on the popularity of president hugo chavez , the most recent study by alfredo keller has confirmed the res ##ound ##ing and sustained fall of the approval rating the president had at the beginning of his administration .
the most telling result is that more than half of those polled believe that it is necessary to remove chavez from office to solve the crisis .
against this 54 percent , 43 percent of those polled prefer to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007 .
according to this , only 20 percent believe the rich and powerful are against chavez .
however , 78 percent of those polled believe there are many poor who oppose him .
this study shows a very clear pro ##no ##unce ##ment in favor of calling a referendum to red ##raf ##t the constitution and restore the balance of power : 75 percent agreed with the referendum , whereas 20 percent rejected it .
although chavez ' edge in voter ' s preference continues to shrink , the effects of a divided opposition still keep him in first place ( which shows the strength of radical chavez supporters ) .
the population ' s disapproval of the government ' s job reaches 93 and 88 . 4 percent on the ins ##ec ##urity and unemployment problems , respectively .
popular support for [ caracas mayor alfredo ) pena climbed from 5 . 5 to 16 . 8 percent . "
the third is the perception of the president as an incapable leader , which is already happening , and the fourth is that venezuelan ##s are able to find a substitute leader .
the difference is back then , chavez ' candidacy raised expectations .
as christians ##en explains , ' if venezuelan ##s did not see unemployment as a problem that could be solved , they would not blame it on chavez ' inca ##pac ##ity .
four of every 10 venezuelan ##s are blaming this problem on him . '
as for the second factor , 43 percent find nothing positive in the government ' s actions .
chavez ' strengths include his personal qualities ( 27 percent ) and clear desire to work ( 17 percent ) .
the fact that two - thirds of venezuelan ##s consider chavez responsible for the country ' s problems shows that he is losing strength in the third aspect of stability :
he added that chavez still leads voter ' s preference with 28 percent . " ]

a former director - general of the pakistani inter - services intelligence ( is ##i ) , ham ##eed gu ##l told ir ##na in an interview here that each country which resisted american he ##ge ##mony was deemed a viola ##tor of human rights .
" in a fit of force , the us wanted to sub ##ju ##gate the entire world community and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle in this direction and the recent report on human rights was also a manifestation of its he ##ge ##mon ##istic designs , " the lieutenant general ( re ##t ##d ) continued .
ham ##eed gu ##l was of the opinion that the us was the only country in the world that had no respect for any religion , faith , norms , dec ##ency , human rights and rules .
" it is unprecedented in the history of the com ##ity of nations that the us forcibly wanted to prevent countries from uphold ##ing religious and cultural values , " he said .
the world would never forget the bar ##bari ##ties it committed on the innocent afghan people , women , children and the elderly , " he firmly said .
" america wants total submission of muslims across the globe , " ham ##eed gu ##l said .
" the situation requires a concert ##ed moral resistance by muslims scholars ; if they remain indifferent to each other ' s plight in the hands of imperial ##ist forces led by the us , they would be crushed one by one , " he warned .
muslims rulers should forge unity in their ranks to resist the ever - increasing us influence ; otherwise , they would be targeted one by one , ham ##eed gu ##l concluded .
" the chinese government denied a requested visit by the uss curtis wilbur , a destroyer , to visit hong kong from april 5 to 9 , " she said adding , " this would have been a routine port call . "
the bar on the uss curtis wilbur with some 34 ##6 crew is seen as reflecting beijing ' s anger over washington ' s decision to allow taiwanese defense minister tang yao - ming to visit florida for a military conference this month .
beijing has twice summoned the us ambassador for dressing ##s down over the issue , while a state - controlled newspaper reported last week that china was preparing to cancel naval exchanges with the united states in retaliation .
there were two other similar episodes of permission being denied before that since the 1997 hand ##over of the former british colony to china .
observers had warned that should the outcome be seen to have been rigged , violence could explode across the volatile southern african nation .
ts ##van ##gi ##rai rejected mug ##abe ' s election victory out of hand .
foreign governments all but dismissed the outcome even before it was announced , threatening to leave mug ##abe internationally isolated despite his victory .
even after the polls closed monday , mug ##abe ' s government kept up the pressure on the opposition by charging md ##c secretary general welsh ##man nc ##ub ##e with high treason , which the party dismissed as a sm ##ear tactic .
nc ##ub ##e , along with ts ##van ##gi ##rai and four other top party officials , had been accused last month of plotting to assassinate the president .
violence has claimed at least 33 lives , mostly those of opposition supporters , since the start of the year .

according to biblical tradition , although david bought the land for the temple and carefully assembled its building materials , he was deemed un ##worthy of constructing the temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands .
the temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from africa and with cedar from lebanon ; the beau ##ties and g ##lor ##ies of jerusalem under solomon have capt ##ivated readers of the bible for almost 3 , 000 years .
the bible tells us that the cruelty and imp ##ie ##ty of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great prophets .
for all his accomplishments , hero ##d was nevertheless hated by his subjects ; he tax ##ed , he tortured , and he ordered the massacre of male jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the herald ##ed messiah .
in about a . d . 30 he and his followers went for pass ##over to jerusalem , which was in unrest at this time , dissatisfied with roman domination .
she found that the city ' s most beautiful roman temple , dedicated to the goddess ap ##hr ##od ##ite , stood on the site of the cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion .
the dome of the rock remains jerusalem ' s most striking monument ; it is counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created .
the holy city remained a back ##water until the 19th century , when renewed interest among christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year .
at the same time , many jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to palestine ( as the holy land was traditionally called ) and especially to jerusalem .
but arab opposition to new jewish immigration and construction in palestine led to increasing strife ; by 1946 , jerusalem was an armed camp .
political and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of terrorism or s ##ni ##ping until the six day war in june 1967 .
today , as always , jerusalem is a city of controversies : religious jews in conflict with secular jews ; palestinians calling for independence ; many residents protesting a wave of high - rise development that many claim will turn the holy city into a holy mega ##lo ##polis .

traditionally , mexico has supported the op ##ec cut ##backs ; however , analysts agreed that it will now tend to support the united states , the main world consumer , and the one that would be adverse ##ly affected by a possible increase in crude prices .
george baker , director of mexico energy intelligence , expressed this opinion : " in the event that the mexican government gives priority to its relationship with the united states , it will not be a game without risks .
and it is possible that , at some given time , op ##ec may hand it the bill for not collaborating in the reduction of the oil supply . "
" the us authorities would not like to have it ( mexico ) as a trading partner and , at the same time , close to op ##ec , " he observed .
he emphasized : " now mexico is positioned between two fronts : it recognizes the need for reducing the supply on the market , but the policy is to support the united states and supply it with more crude if it should become necessary . "
in terms of market , the mexican exports do not play an important role , but the support for op ##ec on the part of mexico , venezuela , and saudi arabia in 1998 and 1999 lent credibility to the policy of cut ##backs , and achieved the recovery of prices .
the army would like to request whoever is engaged in this criminal activity , to stop , " he said .
