The United Nations human rights rapporteur , Maurice Copithorne , on Friday once again repeated his stereotyped allegations against the Islamic Republic by expressing concern over what he called human rights violations in Iran .
Copithorne , who has served in the UN post since 1995 , through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights ( UNCHR ) , whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18 , has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington 's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic .
In other cases , he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities .
For instance , he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran , while the measure has been taken in line with the law .
He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations !
This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime .
Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights .
Herald Reporter - TWO observer groups that have been critical of the just ended presidential election were funded by the European Union , it has been learnt .
According to the sources , the EU which was barred by the Government from observing the election because some of its members were openly supporting the MDC , sent a Ms Maria Macchiaverna to " support the financial management of our assistance " to the Sadc Parliamentary Forum and ZESN .
" This explains why the two groups were critical of the election .
Despite these negative reports , most observer groups have declared the election free and fair .
The Sadc ministerial observer team yesterday congratulated President Mugabe on his victory .
The Tanzanian and Democratic Republic of Congo observer teams also met President Mugabe to congratulate him on his victory and said the election had been free and fair .
One of the officials , who asked not to be identified , said that planning called for the prisoners , not yet charged with crimes , to be manacled together and outnumbered by specially trained guards carrying incapacitating stun guns .
The human rights advocacy group Amnesty International expressed concern about reports that the prisoners " may be drugged , hooded and shackled , " saying that they must be treated with full respect for international standards .
Rumsfeld told reporters on Thursday that every effort would be made to secure hardline prisoners , many considered dangerous and possibly suicidal followers of Bin Laden .
The al - Qaeda leaders is accused by Washington of masterminding the September 11 suicide aircraft attacks on New York and Washington .
' Willing to kill themselves , others ' :
" There are among these prisoners people who are perfectly willing to kill themselves and kill other people , " Rumsfeld added .
His task was to create " a peaceful environment " in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine .
The man who defeated Iraq in 1991 in only six weeks issued a message , saying that the most he hoped for was something less than a mutual cease-fire agreement .
The impression is that , under US sponsorship , the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East .
The latest round of violence was initiated on the day in September 2000 when Ariel Sharon took it upon himself to provoke his Muslim neighbors by visiting an Islamic religious building .
Powell 's words , " we are working on this plan , " are unclear , because he did not say what the plan is , and Israel 's call for a conference on the Middle East is also unclear .
In its warnings and appeals for peace , the United States openly " takes a side " in this conflict , labeling the other side terrorists , similar to those who carried out the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York .
It would be entirely improper if , in its defense of Israel , the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries , such as , Syria and Lebanon , which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations , such as the Hezbolah .
In some circles , these concerns over an alleged new front are seen as an attempt to resolve the smaller Israel - Palestine problem with a bigger one .
The EU 's efforts and US President Bush 's peace initiative through Secretary of State Powell seem like a late resolution , considering that approximately one month ago the Arab countries participating in the summit in Beirut held out an olive branch to Israel through the plan of Saudi Arabia 's heir to the throne , Prince Abdullah , which contained two points : recognition of a Palestinian state [ as published ] in an Arab neighborhood , in return for recognition of the Palestinians ' right to their own country .
Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan , demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab .
In the same manner Israel asked Arafat to leave Ramallah and Palestine , labeling him a troublemaker and politician incapable of controlling the Palestinian suicide bombers .

Bush Criticized for Treating Detainees Inhumanely
The Bush administration has been under international criticism for not treating the detainees humanely .
It recently bowed to international pressure to grant the Taliban prisoners the status of prisoner of war but still refused to cover al Qaeda prisoners with the same treatment .
TAIPEI , Feb 17 ( AFP ) - Taiwan is keeping a wary eye on US President George W. Bush 's China visit despite assurances by Washington that Taipei 's interests would not be traded away during the trip .
Washington had guaranteed Taipei that it would not dilute its backing for the island in return for better relations with Beijing , Taiwan 's foreign ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao- yueh told AFP .
Wu said he believed overall Taiwan interests were protected from knocks by the Bush administration because of the island 's " strong support " from decision -makers in the White House , State Department and Department of Defense .
The sale infuriated Beijing which regards Taiwan an integral part of its territory awaiting reunification , by force if necessary .
The president has called for a peaceful resolution of the lingering sovereignty dispute between Taipei and Beijing which split at the end of a civil war in 1949 .
Compounding fears is speculation that Bush may sign a fresh communique with China in return for Beijing 's support on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear proliferation .
Wu defended the government 's cautious approach warning that Beijing could try to use the situation to gain the upper hand .
" Taiwan 's interest would be harmed if the Chinese leaders took advantage of the occasion by making remarks unfavorable to Taipei and Washington failed to defend Taipei , " Wu warned .
Taipei was angered when then - president Bill Clinton pledged the " three nos " during his China visit in 1998 .
" We hope that this will serve as an occasion for LG to make inroads into the Central Asian region . "
Mugabe Predicts Victory in Zimbabwe 's Election
Zimbabwe 's incumbent President Robert Mugabe Saturday predicted victory in the country 's two - horse presidential race , saying that he will accept the outcome of the election because he will have defeated Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
" I will accept the results more than anything because I will have won , " said Mugabe .
He said those who thought the election process would be rigged were supporters of the MDC party , adding that they were prejudging and wanted to direct the process .
The MDC party has accused Mugabe of using violence and other electoral manipulation to rig the poll .
While defying international pressure to back down from his controversial land reforms , Mugabe has said he needs a new six - year mandate to complete the reforms .
However , the program has drawn sharp international rebuke , particularly from former colonial power Britain , but Mugabe has vowed to press ahead with the reforms .
The European Union imposed sanctions on Mugabe and 19 of his close associates last month , while the United States took the same move , accusing Mugabe of violating human rights and cracking down on the opposition , the media and judiciary .
Mugabe even talked about his desire to keep safeguarding Zimbabwe 's sovereignty and land in spirit when he dies , a dream which the veteran leader said forced him to sacrifice a bright teaching career in the 1950s to lead his compatriots out of colonial rule .
Taro Kono ( 39 ) , son of former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and twice elected lower house Liberal Democratic Party member , wrote a critical comment on the US president 's speech before the Japanese Diet on 19 February .
" During President Bush 's speech , I thought of heckling ; ' What are you going to do with the Kyoto Protocol ? ' and ' How about CTBT ? ' but I refrained .
The United States says the CTBT is unacceptable ; that nobody cares about the BWC ; that there should not be a Kyoto Protocol ; that US citizens have the right to own handguns ; that land mines are necessary ; that the SOFA needs no revision , just a change in application ; and then we should attack Iraq together .
Salt Lake City - based First Security , with $ 5.4 billion in assets , said the agreement is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval , and that it hopes to complete the transaction early next year .
The meeting was the first between the two countries since President George Bush unveiled a new US plan calling for voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic growth rather than mandatory targets .
At the start of the meeting , the US said it would promote research and development into climate change .
President Bush caused an international outcry when he rejected the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change last year , saying it hindered US economic growth .
ISTANBUL , Dec 21 ( A.A ) - Rauf Denktas , the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ( TRNC ) said on Friday that Cyprus is wanted to be given as a gift to those who stole the Cyprus government by means of EU membership .
Denktas said that they are ready to live together with Greek Cypriots in the island , adding that they don`t have the will to send Greek Cypriots from the island .
" This is a terrible period , not only for Zimbabwe but for those who hold the course of democracy dear in Africa and elsewhere . "
Counting in the election , in which Mugabe is battling for his political future against opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai after 22 years in power , began Tuesday amid complaints in Zimbabwe over the conduct of the vote .
Mbeki , Obasanjo and Howard have been mandated by the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting ( CHOGM ) in Australia to decide what action should be taken on the situation in Zimbabwe .
The SADC on Saturday endorsed the vote , despite its Parliamentary Forum , which judging that the March 9 - 11 election " did not conform with the norms and standards of the SADC Parliamentary Forum , " signed on to by Zimbabwe .
South Africa 's observer mission also endorsed the vote , saying in an interim report that " ( o ) verall ... the authorities charged with conducting the elections discharged their work satisfactorily . "
In terms of the Commonwealth 's mandate , action against Zimbabwe could range from collective disapproval to suspension .
Indian forces retaliated , killing four Pakistani soldiers and destroying six bunkers , he said .
Mao Tse-tung was passionate about this idea .
The " elder brother " ( the Chinese people used to call the Soviet Union this ) was not against helping the " younger brother " in the field of modernization .
Your gift to Goodwill will help the many people who want to tell their own stories of success .
The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote .
The Nigerian leader , President Olusegun Obasanjo , had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain 's negative position regarding Zimbabwe , but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner .
Then Mudenge rose to his feet , strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand .
Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future .
But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government , the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election .
Instead , an Australian member of the Federal Parliament , Julie Bishop , vented her anger towards the President and Government , and the electoral process , in Australia 's media .
A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission , who is the well - respected , Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country , held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known .
Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of " consensus " , she and others of a similar view were dismissed as " troublemakers " by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer .
The Commonwealth Secretary - General , Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country 's decision to condemn Zimbabwe 's presidential election .
Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki , however , have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth .
The European Parliament , which convened yesterday in Strasbourg , decided to advise the 15 member states of the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Israel and , specifically , to suspend association agreements with Jerusalem .
In addition , the Parliament called for imposing a weapons embargo on Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
Earlier this week , Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel , who does not miss an opportunity to provoke Israel , threatened that the EU would once again reconsider its relations with Jerusalem .
European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed similar sentiments : in his opinion , the EU should consider imposing an economic " punishment " on Israel in protest against the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories .
The same goes for Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique , who was offended after Israel refused to allow him and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah .
However , the fact that certain countries have a more balanced view of the conflict is not the only reason to doubt that anti-Israeli decisions will , in fact , be adopted .
The Europeans know that repeated denunciations of Israel , not to mention its punishment , will not lead to a solution of the conflict .
EU External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten expressed this clearly Tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between Israel and the EU would do nothing to enhance Jerusalem 's readiness to listen to European representatives .
At the start of his Asian tour , Bush dismissed a chilly reception by US allies to his " axis of evil " rhetoric , telling reporters in Tokyo , " I will keep all options on the table .
" We want to resolve all issues peacefully , whether it be Iraq , Iran or North Korea , " Bush said , speaking next to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi .
Bush has lumped those three countries together in what terms an " axis of evil , " in language that has riled US allies .
The president renewed his pledge to thwart terrorist groups who want to " mate up " with regimes hoping to acquire weapons of mass destruction and said " nations will come with us " if the US - led war on terrorism is extended .
Asked about French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine 's criticism of the " axis " concept as " simplistic , " Bush said : " I understand what happens in the international arena ; people say things .
But his tough stand on P'yongyang has provoked concern in Seoul , where President Kim Tae-chung , who is in the last year of his five - year term , has been trying to prise the hermit state out of isolation .
South Korean ministers fear Bush 's tough talking may put back by years Kim 's so-called Sunshine Policy of establishing a permanent peace .
Angry anti- US protests erupted in Seoul ahead of Bush 's arrival with police storming the American Chamber of Commerce and detaining 32 students occupying the building .
During the three - hour occupation , protesters hurled leaflets proclaiming Bush to be a " war freak " .
" We 've made no secret of the fact that we think that the world will be much safer when the Iraqi people have a regime that they deserve instead of the regime that they have , " National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told CBS television .
Washington has long accused Baghdad , under UN sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait , of developing weapons of mass destruction .
" It is the United States that is threatening Iraq and not the contrary .
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pledged " undivided support " for the fight against terrorism a week after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , saying , " Germany is ready for risks , including military ones , but not for adventures . "
Iran , which has long had tense relations with its western neighbor , voiced opposition to a new US strike against Iraq .
" We hope that the issue would be solved through peaceful means , with initiatives from the UN secretary general and a more active role by the UN , " Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi told a news conference .
A diplomatic source said the affair could become " embarrassing " for European countries , " because of the insistence of the Americans on judging for themselves " those who supported al - Qaeda .
Washington alleges that Tehran has allowed al - Qa'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran , which Iranian officials have hotly denied but said they would act if provided with evidence .
In another verbal attack Kharazi accused the United States of wanting to exercise " world dictatorship " since the " horrible attacks " of September 11 .
" They are seeking unilaterally to become the masters of the world and want to sweep aside all competitors from other countries . "
We did not have very much but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained , and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories , reading poems , and singing to us .
So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes .
So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow , do what she tell told me to do , she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family .
And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up , wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table .
And her little girl just complained , " I do n't want to wash the dishes .
My leg hurts , my head hurts .
The little girl disappointed her mother so badly , but her mother said , " How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes ? "
Now that knife , when I went to sleep it really scared me .
All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school .
That was my dream , to teach school .
So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said , " Baby , I really want you to go to college .
It 's always been my dream that my children all go to school .
Um , I remember once , when I was working in a mill , and I was spinning yarn , and I was saying to myself , and , I was praying actually , and I said , " God , one day I want to work in the school system .
But he told me to go ahead and try it , so I took the entrance test , and they accepted me into at the school , and I took some courses there .
After a while , the principal said , " I would like for you to bring me your , um , transcript so I can see what your grades are like . "
And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year .
I enjoy my job very much .
And he told me I would have to write this paper .
Well I did n't like writing at the time but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper .
And I went to , um , one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it , and she thought it was an excellent paper .
Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity , so I felt very proud of myself .
My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school .
So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband .
After all of this was , after I , I decided not to continue I 've never pursued the fact of going back to school .
But I love what I do and , uh , anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so .
So I had to , I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill .
I did n't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really , really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park .
But then , after awhile , I fell in love with Berryhill .
If I 'm not mistaken I think I 've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years , 17 , 18 years I 've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire .
And I enjoy what I do .

Ivanic and Finance Minister Milenko Vracar are to meet with the governor of province Hebei Niu Maosheng , who invited them to the visit , and other officials of this province .
MANILA , Nov 24 ( AFP ) - President Gloria Arroyo praised Malaysia on Saturday for the swift arrest of Muslim leader Nur Misuari , whose forces embarked on a fresh rebellion this week in the southern Philippines .
Arroyo was " very satisfied that the Malaysian government has been efficient enough to arrest him , " her spokesman Rigoberto Tiglao told DZBB radio here .
Manila wants to put Misuari on trial for rebellion in connection with a revolt on Monday which claimed at least 113 lives .
Misuari launched his revolt after Arroyo decided to back an MNLF rival in an election to be held Monday to choose the next ARMM governor .
Malaysia , which had given sanctuary to Misuari and his guerrillas in the early 1970s , has called on Misuari to end a bloody six-day - old rebellion by his followers in the southern Philippine island of Jolo .
US and Philippine officials say the group has links with Saudi militant Osama bin Laden , blamed for the September 11 attacks on the United States that killed about 4,000 people .
He expressed the government 's determination to put Misuari in jail .
One can name more than a dozen countries which are contemplating the acquisition of mass destruction weapons at one speed or another .
Washington seems to be particularly disturbed and feel that its own national security is being threatened only when the nations which acquire mass destruction weapons are authoritarian or repressive , irrespective of the pace of amassing weaponry .
This is , in fact , the fear of all countries , as they feel that democratic regimes are more restrained and responsible when it comes to resorting to weapons of mass destruction .
The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group .
The Bonn Conference however , which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate , could be appraised as an exception and a relative success .
After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference , it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants , who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry .
But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries ; rather , the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group .
The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [ of America ] .
American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale , possession , and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [ as published ] of American citizens , and equal to reducing their margin of security .
Critics of the meeting , on the margin of the conference , up held the view that the American government , instead of heeding the wishes of international community , and protecting the security of world nations , and above all the safety of its own citizens , has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military - industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments .
The most important of the three conferences , which subsequently gained even more prominence , was the conference in Genova ; perhaps even more so for the results " not obtained " at the conference , and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting .
The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization , who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty .
Because , from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization , the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries .
Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too , neither Russia , China , Japan , nor even the European Union , had shown any enthusiasm ; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project .
Whereas , beforehand , it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well .
Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America , European Union , and Russia and China .
Jacques Chirac , the French President , responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization , had said : " They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor ... "
In the remarks made by these political leaders , one point is interesting and calls for reflection : if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations , while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them , then it must be said that they are only the elected [ leaders ] of their own nation [ people ] , and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide !
As regards the recent conference ( Bonn Meeting ) , although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences , nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious , one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts , and implementation of the agreements , even though they are not protected by any sanctions .
The truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year .
After defending his " crown " to his last - ditch efforts , the veteran statesman , who bragged him a " young old man " with abundant reserves of energy to continue ruling Zimbabwe , has finally won the political boxing match against Tsvangirai , a more youthful opponent , who celebrated his 50th birthday on Sunday .
Analysts said Mugabe , the last of the old African nationalists who rode to power on the colonial winds of change , has won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU - PF 's land policy , under which the government was seizing idle farms from white farmers , who own the bulk of the country 's arable land , to resettle landless peasants .
Their comments were echoed by rural voters , who said the majority of them , who voted for ZANU - PF , were voting for land , and they will get it .
" People in the rural areas support the ruling party because our party has been genuine on its policy on land reform .
Mugabe , whose strongholds are in the countryside , took election campaign to urban areas , where Tsvangirai enjoyed much support among those urban workers .
While depending heavily on his rural support , Mugabe told thousands of urbanizers he would focus on housing and job creation if re-elected .
" We want to come up with policies that will result in the creation of more jobs for the youths and those leaving school and colleges .
Despite the economic hardships and food shortages currently experienced by Zimbabweans , analysts said there are other major achievements Mugabe 's government is credited for .
During Mugabe 's 22 - year-rule , the country used to boast of having a good education system and a good health system , which was to some extent affected by the lackluster economy .
However , a large number of middle - aged people , who benefited from Mugabe 's reign , are still nostalgic about the lost time and voted for him with a strong hope for economic revival .
Although some things have gone wrong under ZANU - PF leadership , Zimbabweans still chose Mugabe , the political strong man , because they said they were lured by his Millennium Economic Recovery Program .
Under his blueprint , the government hopes to stabilize the economy through curtailing state expenditure , reforming public enterprises and expanding agriculture .
" We will continue obviously to keep the situation under review , but frankly , I think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in Afghanistan .
Hours after the vanguard entered from the west , a tank column halted its advance from the east , fearing hostile fire .

( CORR ) Spanish premier , EU leader urge Russia to ratify Kyoto Protocol
The current president of the EU , Jose Maria Aznar , and the president of the European Commission , Romano Prodi , have sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change .
In the letter , to which Efe has had access , Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community .
" Therefore , we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated , in other words , in early June of this year , " they add .
However , the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification .
They make this request " convinced of the Russian Federation 's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol " and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the " leadership " which they believe they have shared " with such fruitful results , in international cooperation in the fight against climate change " .
The remarks seriously violated the commitments made by the US government in the three Sino - US Joint Communiques , said Zhang , adding that those remarks , out of ulterior motives , interfered in China 's internal affairs .
Zhang stressed that history had repeatedly proved that US arms sales to Taiwan and its elevation US - Taiwan relations would only incite the separatists in their attempts to split Taiwan from mainland and would lead to the deterioration of Taiwan Straits situation and boiled down to the jeopardy of the interests of the US itself .
The spokeswoman urged the US to strictly abide by the serious commitments that it had made to the Chinese government and Chinese people and stop the wrong actions so as to avoid further damage to Sino - US relations .
The Taiwan issue was at the core of Sino - US relations , reiterated Zhang , emphasizing that any measures or remarks that ran against the three Sino - US Joint Communiques would undermine Sino - US relations .
" We hope US behaves as it says , strictly abide by the three Sino - US Communiques and stop using the Taiwan issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs , " Zhang said .
This left the impression that Japan stands alone on this issue because European countries have been cool to Bush 's " axis of evil " rhetoric .
However , it will be difficult for Japan to provide support to the US , as it did when the US attacked Afghanistan , if US forces launch military action against Iraq .
He urged Japan to follow the US by saying : " The international community needs to cooperate to change Iran , Iraq , and North Korea 's action pattern ( of spreading weapons of mass destruction ) .
European countries are critical of Bush 's " axis of evil " remark .
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine criticized the remark as " simplistic interpretation of the world . "
However , Koizumi said , " I take the remark as the indication of the President 's strong resolve to fight terrorism . "
It is possible that if the US military attack Iraq , Japan , which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark , will be asked to provide active support to the US as it did during US attacks on Afghanistan .
" It is also politically very difficult " to enact a new law considering the declining support for the Koizumi Cabinet , said a source within the Prime Minister 's Official Residence .
If Japan does not give any support to possible US attacks on Iraq despite its understanding of the axis of evil rhetoric , Bush 's expectations on the Koizumi administration will certainly change to disappointment .
Although the Japanese Government has expressed understanding of Bush 's axis of evil remark , it does not hope to see the US taking military action .
Because of this , Koizumi noted the need for the international community to cooperate in tackling Iraqi issues and enthusiastically asked Bush to not take the bold course of launching military action .
In reply , the President said , " We want to resolve all issues peacefully , and we intend to continue diplomatic efforts . "
Mr. Tsvangirai , the 50 - year- old leader of the Movement for Democratic Change , alleged in an interview that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution the ruling ZANU - PF has waged against him and his supporters .
He also spoke about the support his country 's opposition movement has received from abroad , and his pending trial on treason charges , both issues with Canadian connections .
But he focused on the violence and hunger that have plagued many Zimbabweans since the controversial presidential election , at least in part a state- orchestrated operation aimed at crushing the opposition , he said .
It 's part of Mugabe 's grand strategy to target the MDC 's supporter base . "
He said the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe , where opposition to ZANU - PF is strongest .
The United Nations World Food Program warned last week that as many as 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation from the drought , compounded by government -sponsored invasions of white - owned commercial farms that have crippled production of maize and wheat .
" According to reports we have received , they are taken to the police to denounce the MDC , then to the war veterans , where they go through a public confession , " Mrs. Eppel said .
Meanwhile , Mr. Tsvangirai alleged , the land-reform plan , nominally launched to resettle one million poor families , is actually putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite .
The opposition leader commended Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe 's regime .
" The international community can support us so far , but it can never remove the shackles of repression , " he said .
He said the violence , hunger and economic turmoil are strengthening his country 's appetite for a public campaign for change .
" There is no struggle without casualties , but we do n't want to engineer any reckless action , " he cautioned .
On May 31 , he is to stand trial on a charge of treason , accused of plotting to have Mr. Mugabe assassinated .
The opposition leader has denied the charge all along , and although he was reluctant to go into depth about a case still before the courts , he did make brief reference to the prosecution 's star witness , Montreal - based consultant and former Israeli intelligence agent Ari Ben - Menashe , who may or may not travel to Zimbabwe for the trial .
" If the prosecution 's key witness is reluctant to testify , how will they proceed ? "
Though the American forces are expected to be involved initially in advising and training Filipino counterterrorist units , senior American military officials have said they could become involved in direct military action if the Philippine government requested it .
Mr. Rumsfeld declined to discuss details about the growing American involvement in the Philippines , where Abu Sayyaf guerrillas have been battling government troops in the southern island of Basilan .
But earlier this week , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz said that American Special Operations forces might become involved in " direct support of Philippine military operations , " though he added that the government seemed " anxious " to do the job itself .
" There 's no question that we believe that if they could clear the Abu Sayyaf group out of Basilan Island , that would be a small blow against the extended Al Qaeda network , " Mr. Wolfowitz said .
Senior military officials have said they are increasingly concerned that there are other equally sophisticated and well - fortified underground complexes elsewhere in Afghanistan that could become guerrilla bases for remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces .
They used to rely upon the fact that they thought we were soft .

From a power base in Anatolia , the Persians overran the eastern Aegean Islands and set their sights on the Cyclades .
The Persians were defeated , and Athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it .
However , a movement was growing on the Greek peninsula against Ottoman rule and for an independent Greek state .
Greece moved in to administer the land , but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater Greece .
In 1923 , Turkey broke away from the tired Ottoman rulers , and Kemal Ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support .
He promised a modern state for his people , but as the situation became volatile , civil strife broke out in Turkish cities , and those considered Greek were victims of threats and violence .
The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism , and Greece along with the Aegean Islands became exciting destinations for northern Europeans escaping their damp , cool summers .
Politically , the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands , although the divorce of Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative Greek society .
Whether this will ever happen remains to be seen , but perhaps the aid offered by Greece to Turkey after 1999 ' s devastating earthquake is a sign that the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to diminish .
Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made , the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia .
The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad , work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002 , with launches beginning from 2004 .
Therefore , plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia 's objections .
If a deadlock in negotiations occurs , the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator .
Unlike other experts , Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [ about the Australian planned space station ] .
Israeli Parliament Speaker Slams Zionist Occupation
In a rare move on Tuesday , Israeli Parliament Speaker Avraham Burg condemned the Zionist regime 's occupation of Palestinian territories .
In an interview with the Qatari Al Jazeera television network , Burg denounced the policy , much to the displeasure of Israeli officials and right- wing MPs .
He repeatedly said that the occupation of the Palestinian territories could lead to corruption in Israel and would only create scandals for the regime .
Earlier this week some 50 Israeli army officers were reported to have been on strike and refused to attack Palestinian ruled areas in protest of the occupation policies of the Zionist regime .

Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa 's Independent Electoral Commission ( IEC ) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards .
" Personally I felt that one is going to be used here , but I nevertheless hoped the presence of outsiders in Zimbabwe would stop some illegal acts which may have been committed . "
She said international observers were treated with suspicion by the police .
SAOM on Monday stopped short of declaring the Zimbabwean presidential election free and fair , but the African National Congress majority on the committee declared the poll " credible " .
The majority report , endorsed only by the ANC , said the observer mission had noted that over three million Zimbabweans had cast their votes and this substantially represented the will of the people .

At the State House , where the ceremony was held , thousands of ZANU - PF supporters in clothing emblazoned with Mugabe 's portrait , were singing and dancing to celebrate his victory , with a hope that Mugabe will finally deliver on his promises to give them the land currently owned by the country 's white minority .
He told thousands of cheering supporters that " land reforms must proceed with greater speed and strength " to shore up the economy , badly battered by years of political instability .
" We want to make sure that blacks play a meaningful role in the economy , and we will do that through the land reforms , " said Mugabe .
In the run-up to the March 9 - 11 poll , critics had accused the Zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country 's closest - fought election since independence in 1980 .
But he told the nation that in spite of stiff opposition to the agrarian reforms from powerful Western countries , especially the country 's former colonial power of Britain , he would press ahead to seize farms from whites and resettle blacks .
He described his victory in the poll as " a stunning blow to imperialism " and thanked African countries for supporting Zimbabwe in its stand -off with Western countries over the agrarian reforms .
Many African leaders have supported Mugabe 's re-election victory in Zimbabwe 's crucial election , which they said was " transparent , credible , free and fair " .
Mugabe said Zimbabwe needed their continued support against what he called hostile international attention .
" When they aim at Zimbabwe , it is not Zimbabwe alone , they have other countries in mind . "
In his campaign for re-election , the Zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused Britain and its Western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in Zimbabwe , and the region , by installing a compliant opposition party in power .
" Thanks to the people , our people and the people of Africa for this joint effort in rejecting this neocolonial attempt .
However , Mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity , incorporating his closest rival in the poll , to ensure political and economic stability in Zimbabwe .
The two , along with Australian Prime Minister John Howard , are members of a Commonwealth panel charged with assessing the election and recommending possible action by the group against Zimbabwe .
The European Union ( EU ) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe .
Sunday 's inauguration ceremony was boycotted by EU countries , the US and some members of the Commonwealth .
" Our energy is better spent on reviving the economy than plotting to bring down each other , " he said .
The MDC party rejected the voting results , claiming the government rigged the poll in favor of incumbent President Mugabe .

In a meeting with 25 of the scholars Thursday , Tsai said in response to a question on whether Taiwan is afraid of over-reliance on the mainland market that the island will be able to achieve balanced economic growth as long as it strikes a balance between maintaining its sovereignty , developing its economy globally and normalizing relations with the mainland .
" On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of China ( Taiwan 's official name ) , I would like to extend our full support to the George W. Bush administration in its any decision and act against terrorists , " Chen said while meeting Oregon governor John Kitzhaber .
Taiwan 's Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao had vowed to back the US in fighting terrorism saying Taiwan had " no option " but to do so , despite a lack of diplomatic ties between Taipei and Washington .
In April Bush approved the biggest US arms package to Taiwan since 1992 .
US Secretary of State Colin Powell , described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush 's administration , is trying to " patch up " President Bush 's statements , especially his latest one in which he made reckless threats at the " axis of evil , " namely Iran , Iraq and North Korea .
A day after President Bush 's threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction , Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that " characterizing these counties as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them . "
Oddly enough , speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush 's speech and his threats to " the axis of evil " like any other US citizen .
It lumped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as part of the " axis of evil " only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted .
He does not want to repeat his father 's mistake , being defeated in the next elections because of economic factors .

Seven months after having rejected the Kyoto Protocol because he considered it to be without scientific basis , detrimental to US economic interests , and unfair in not obliging medium-sized nations ( like Brazil and India ) to reduce their gas emissions in the same proportion as that imposed on industrialized countries , Bush made public the plan that , he promised , would not have any of the defects of the Kyoto Protocol and would achieve the same , if not better , results .
More important are two indisputable conclusions , both potentially embarrassing to the Bush administration and extremely threatening to the world as a whole .
The long - standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government 's persistent alignment with their goals .
The second conclusion is that , contrary to what some optimists were predicting after 11 September , Bush seems to have decided to stick to a course of arrogant unilateralism when conducting his foreign policy .
After the World Trade Center and Pentagon tragedies , there were some who thought that Washington 's rapprochement with its traditional partners was inevitable , with the goal of defeating the threat of international terrorism .
The Israeli Government hopes that this tactic would eventually lead to an integrated and total agreement when all its parts are put together to form a map of " cantons " that Israel envisions for the occupied Palestinian lands .
The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence .
